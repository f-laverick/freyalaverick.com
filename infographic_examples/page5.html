              The duo parted ways in 1993 only a year after their hit song Stay reached the top of the UK Charts for eight weeks.

              Both Fahey and Detroit were very different people and atrists and the break down of the band was ultimately due to these differences, it became inevitable that the relationship would end at some point, it didn't however end in the best way.

              So as a result of these misconceptions and personal differences, the duo split in 1993 and didn't speak to each other for 26 years...
