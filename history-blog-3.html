              The term 'Art Nouveau' refers to an artistic movement that became most popular in Europe between 1890 and 1910. It was largely inspired by nature and aimed to break down the distinction between fine and applied art. The definition of 'Art Nouveau' differs depending on the location, as different artists interpreted the meaning in different ways. <br> Below are some of the major differences interpreted by different regions.

              Charles Rennie Mackintosh was possibly one of the most well known Scottish artists, frequently associated with a new, individual interpretation of the art nouveau style. Mackintosh studied at the Glasgow School of Art, and it was there that he met Herbert MacNair and the MacDonald sisters. "The Four" created their own style inspired by, and sharing many art nouvaeu characteristics. Their work focused on elongated forms, with strong verticals and the inclusion of the human figure.

              The city of Nancy in France is home to some of the most incredible art nouveau architecture anywhere. The city has a large range of architectural styles, however, all have been inspired by nature. The buildings in Nancy are decorated in ceramics, stained-glass and wrought-iron work, all of which are characteristics of earlier art nouveau architecture.

              The Vienna Secession was a movement created in 1897, led by Gustav Klimt, and made of artists who had resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists. It was through this new movement that artists like Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann made their names within the industry. The Vienna Secession became known as the Austrian version of 'Jugendstil', which in english, is art nouveau. Otto Wagner was an Austrian architect, known for the evolution of architecture during the late 1800s and early 1900s. In the 1890s, Wagner really found his style and stuck to the floral and art nouveau inspirations.

              The Gran Via is one of the most well known streets in Madrid. It's buildings are a mixture of art nouveau and art deco; the leading styles of the time. Many of Madrid's buildings are host to the forms found in nature; inspired by the world around us. They are also inspired by the First World War. At this time, money was short, and as a result of this, building materials were limited. Due to this fact, most buildings were symmetrical and streamlined, this was in an attempt to lower costs during construction. Despite these limitations, Madrid has some of the best examples of art nouveau inspired architecture in the world.
