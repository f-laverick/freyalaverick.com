          Project 1: Three Dimensional Design

            <p>
              This was the first packaging project we had been given during our first year. We had to explore the damage single use plastics have on the environment and come up with a practical solution that used a biodegradable material, in this case, card/cardboard. It was important to take into account the reasons why the plastic packaging chose plastic as the main material; was this for protection, hygiene ect.

              Research 
            </h3>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was my research. I looked into different forms of plastic packaging that are in supermarkets and thought about the pros and cons for many of them. I eventually decided on my product; drinks cans packaging.

              After going out and doing some market research, it became clear that cans and bottles are packaged in both plastic and card. I had to make the packaging entirely from card, so strength and sturdiness was key.

              Net Research

            <p>
              As strength was important in this project, I looked at different nets and the benefits of each, but then decided on a more simplified version. The simplified net would allow me more room to experiment with the surface graphics. I worried that if I chose a more complicated net, with the addition of the surface graphics, the overall outcome would be too overpowering.

              Surface Graphics
            </h3>

            <p>
              I originally did two different designs that would appeal to different audiences. This allowed me room to adapt the design and the ability to choose my favourite at the end. Each net has been inspired by different artists. The lemon and ginger net has been inspired by the English illustrator Emma Dibben, while the passion fruit and lime net has been inspired by the English designer Tracey English. I thought that each of their styles suited the target audience appropriately.

              Mock Ups
            </h3>
            <br> 
            <p>
              I started off creating the surface graphics for the whole box. I was very pleased with this outcome as I felt they were appropriate for their given audiences. I expanded upon this design and made the graphics fit a sleeve. I am happy with the end result of the sleeves, I think the design looks better not being over the whole surface; it is less overwhelming, and I believe gives the end product a cleaner finish.

              Final Design
            </h3>
            <br> 
            <p>
              I like both of the designs above as they target very different audiences. The lemon and ginger packaging would target a more mature and traditional audience, while the passion fruit one would target a slightly younger audience. Both designs have been adapted to fit the same net in different ways.  
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
              I have chosen the passion fruit sleeve as my final outcome because the simplicity of the design matches the simplicity of the sleeve; neither one outweighs the other. The sleeve would also be cheaper to mass produce and would make the box more easily reusable.
