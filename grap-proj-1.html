          Project 1: Alignment & Hierarchy
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              This project is the first of many in which the fundamental elements of graphic design will be explored.  
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>In this project we were exploring the skills of alignment and hierarchy in relation to poster design. This meant creating a consistant structure while establishing a clear visible code throughout the design.

              Alignment
            </h3>
            <p>
              For any design project alignment is a key skill. Alignment refers to the visual structure of the page. You can nearly always tell when elements haven't been aligned correctly; even to an untrained eye. A design that has been aligned correctly will look clean and will create a clear pathway through the work, making the job of the viewer much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Below is an example of instances where alignemt can be used to create a clear visual pathway. It should be clear where the viewer is being taken from the placement of all elements.

              Process - Tibor Kalman
            </h3>    
            <p>
            Through carrying out my research I found that Kalman was possibly most well known for his magazine 'Colors' and the ways in which he approached the topics of diversity and culture. It seemed that Kalman documented his ideas and feeling through his magazine. We could not use our subject's name or face on the box so I decided to take his idea of documenting, and show diversity and culture through photographs. To me, the photographs would capture that moment in time that Kalman looked for.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I started off by looking at different photographers and portraits on the internet, in order to find ones that would match Kalman's personality.
            </p>
            <br>  
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/processtk1.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/processtk1small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/processtk2.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/processtk2small.jpg"></a>
              </div> 
            <p>
            While looking into different photographers, I stumbled across Magnum Photos. There was something about them that stopped me in my tracks. Through the use of black and white photography, they were able to capture the emotion and rawness that no other photo could achieve. That is when I made the decision that I wanted my box to have black and white imagery on. I wanted to try and capture this strength that Kalman saw in the world. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The first thing I needed to do to achieve my goal was to find three portraits that showed this rawness that I was looking for. Once I had found the three that I was happy with I had to think of the material to print them on. In a previous project I had become familiar with lazertran. I liked the effect it gave and though it would be appropriate for this project. As the photos would be see through, I thought this would add the the documented feel. I printed the protraits onto the lazertran and transferred it onto thin perspex. The hardest part of this process was the transfer. Lazertran is very delicate, so moving it without it ripping was challenging. 
            </p>

              </div> 
            <p>
            The next task was to find a way to form the box. I had the three sides and the base, I just needed to think of a way to connect them all. After much experimenting I found the easiest and most effective way would be to use a strip of card to stick them together. I used double sided tape and the card acted as a way to cover it up.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Once the box was together I couldn't help but think something was missing. I decided to add to the base. I added orange string to the bottom, creating a web effect. I wanted this to represent the way that everyone, no matter how different on the outside, is the same. We might look different,, but it is what is on the inside that matters. I believe that this is what Kalman was trying to capture in is work. To finish the cube off, I added a camera. This represented capturing the moment; this screenshot in time. It was the documenting factor.
            </p>

              </div>   
            <p>
            Overall I am very happy with the effect created, I think that the portraits came out as strong as I wanted them and the lazertran was a good material to achieve the effect. If I were to do it again I would try to communicate more of Kalman himself. I showed his ideas but not necessarily him as a person.

              Research - Neil Armstrong
            </h3> 
            <p>
            After having completed the celebrity box for Tibor Kalman, I decided to resubmit the project with a different celebrity as the subject. I chose Neil Armstrong because I thought I could make the outcome more visually pleasing and interesting to look at. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Before starting my research into Armstrong I already knew quite a lot about him, I just needed to find an appropriate way to visually demonstrate this. Armstrong was part of an American crew that landed Apollo 11 on the moon in 1969. He was the first ever human to step foot on the moon's surface.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In 1957, after the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik 1, fears and imaginations were sparked around the world. Possibilities suddenly seemed greater. In early 1969 it was thought that Buzz Aldrin would be the first man to step foot on the moon, however after much discussion, it was decided that as Armstrong was a civilian and the commander that it should be up to him.

              Process - Neil Armstrong
            </h3>    
            <p>
            After looking into Neil Armstrong, I found the most well known and visually interesting event in his life was the moon landing. It was important that I really made it clear who he was. Looking at the previous celebrity box I made, I really liked the effect the lazertran gave, so I knew I wanted to create a similar effect. This box was also documenting an event so I thought the see through aspect would be appropriate. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The first thing I needed to do was think about how I wanted the cube to look. I wanted the bottom of the cube to resemble the moons surface. This would give a direct link to the event. To achieve this look I used polystyrene to create the texture and then newspaper and mod roc to smooth it over. 
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
            I wanted the footprint of Armstrong to be the only thing on the surface, I felt that that in itself would be a large enough clue on who my person was. I used das clay to create the boot print and then painted over the surface to try and make everything blend in.
            </p>
            <br>
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil1.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil1small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil2.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil2small.jpg"></a>

                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil4.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil4small.jpg"></a>
              </div> 
            <p>
            I had ordered five sheets of 3mm perspex, so once that had arrived I needed to think of appropriate imagery to cover the sides of the cube. I wanted the audience to look through the images and see the footprint inside. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The images I chose, I believe tell the story of the moon landing. The first image are the families at home watching the moment on the TV, the second image is a count down; representing the count down until the launch, the third image is the launch itself and the fourth image is mission control once the launch had occurred.  Instead of printing onto lazertran, which would give a darker appearance, I chose to print onto acetate. This gave a subtler look and allowed the audience to see through the cube easier. On the top of the cube I attached the quote that Armstrong said on the moon 'That's one small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind'. My idea was that the audience would look through the top of the box and see the footprint. This quote links directly to the event and seemed to work well. 
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
            To add to the overall effect I drilled holes in the bottom of the box and added small lights. The idea was that they would light up the images and draw attention to the boot print. 
            </p>

            <p>  
            I am very happy with the outcome of this project. I had no major problems and I achieved the desired effect using the lights. I believe the box tells enough information about my chosen person and I think anything more would risk ruining the outcome.
