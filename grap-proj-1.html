          Project 1: Alignment & Hierarchy
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              This project is the first of many in which the fundamental elements of graphic design will be explored.  
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>In this project we were exploring the skills of alignment and hierarchy in relation to poster design. This meant creating a consistant structure while establishing a clear visible code throughout the design.

              Alignment
            </h3>
            <p>
              For any design project alignment is a key skill. Alignment refers to the visual structure of the page. You can nearly always tell when elements haven't been aligned correctly; even to an untrained eye. A design that has been aligned correctly will look clean and will create a clear pathway through the work, making the job of the viewer much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Below is an example of instances where alignemt can be used to create a clear visual pathway. It should be clear where the viewer is being taken from the placement of all elements.

              Hierarchy
            </h3>    
            <p>
              Hierarchy is another major principle in the world of graphic design. It is essential to create an order of importance within a design, so important pieces of information can easily be singled out. This helps attract and hold the viewer's attention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              As well as being used for text, hierarchy can be applied to many things. Websites show a common use of hierarchy; from the size of the navigation bar to the hero image and footer. The placement of these elements will affect the overall visual aesthetic of the design.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I began this project by looking at the different ways both alignment and hierarchy have been used in previous pieces of design. This helped give me an idea of what would visually work and what wouldn't. Before digging deeper into this project, I didn't really comprehend the depth that the subject goes into; it is truely an art in itself. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The main thing I wanted to focus on was the importance of grids. Before today I didn't know that there are four types of grid in layout design. All of the grids share a similar purpose; to establish a clear linear relationship and to provide a visual structure to the page. Possibly one of the most commonly used grids is the column grid. This can be found in newspapers and magazines. The columns are used to help the content line up correctly and allow the page to flow. The more columns there are in the grid, the more flexibility you as a designer have.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Another frequently used grid is the baseline grid. This is used just as the column grid but allows for a little bit more movement. Baseline grids are usually created in 12pt increments and allow you to hang content from them. These are sometimes called washing lines as the content hangs from them vertically.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Freeform grids are less commonly used and are mainly for the odd page in a magazine or for a one off design. They have ranging lines which are indicated by an image or elements within the design. The ranging lines allow natural alignments to occur and major elements to sit aesthetically on the page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The fourth type of grid is the modular grid. This has both horizontal and vertival divisions in which content can hang from. The modules created from this grid make it much easier when laying out a large amount of content. In the 1950s and 60s, designers like Karl Gerstner and Emil Ruder developed the modular grid layout.

              Theatre production posters
            </h3> 
            <p>
              The next thing I did was look at past theatre production posters. This gave me an idea of what was already out there and how different designers tackled the task. The biggest fear I had was the large amount of copy text the poster needed to include. I didn't want it to look too cluttered. I made sure to look at posters that had been designed using a variety of the grid types, this gave me a wider understanding of the subject area.

              Process - Neil Armstrong
            </h3>    
            <p>
            After looking into Neil Armstrong, I found the most well known and visually interesting event in his life was the moon landing. It was important that I really made it clear who he was. Looking at the previous celebrity box I made, I really liked the effect the lazertran gave, so I knew I wanted to create a similar effect. This box was also documenting an event so I thought the see through aspect would be appropriate. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The first thing I needed to do was think about how I wanted the cube to look. I wanted the bottom of the cube to resemble the moons surface. This would give a direct link to the event. To achieve this look I used polystyrene to create the texture and then newspaper and mod roc to smooth it over. 
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
            I wanted the footprint of Armstrong to be the only thing on the surface, I felt that that in itself would be a large enough clue on who my person was. I used das clay to create the boot print and then painted over the surface to try and make everything blend in.
            </p>
            <br>
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil1.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil1small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil2.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil2small.jpg"></a>

                <a href="images/vcomproj1/procneil4.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj1/procneil4small.jpg"></a>
              </div> 
            <p>
            I had ordered five sheets of 3mm perspex, so once that had arrived I needed to think of appropriate imagery to cover the sides of the cube. I wanted the audience to look through the images and see the footprint inside. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The images I chose, I believe tell the story of the moon landing. The first image are the families at home watching the moment on the TV, the second image is a count down; representing the count down until the launch, the third image is the launch itself and the fourth image is mission control once the launch had occurred.  Instead of printing onto lazertran, which would give a darker appearance, I chose to print onto acetate. This gave a subtler look and allowed the audience to see through the cube easier. On the top of the cube I attached the quote that Armstrong said on the moon 'That's one small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind'. My idea was that the audience would look through the top of the box and see the footprint. This quote links directly to the event and seemed to work well. 
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
            To add to the overall effect I drilled holes in the bottom of the box and added small lights. The idea was that they would light up the images and draw attention to the boot print. 
            </p>

              </div>
            <p>  
            I am very happy with the outcome of this project. I had no major problems and I achieved the desired effect using the lights. I believe the box tells enough information about my chosen person and I think anything more would risk ruining the outcome.
