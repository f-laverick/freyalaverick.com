          Exercise 1: Alignment & Hierarchy
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              This project is the first of many in which the fundamental elements of graphic design will be explored.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>In this project we were exploring the skills of alignment and hierarchy in relation to poster design. This meant creating a consistant structure while establishing a clear visible code throughout the design.

              Alignment
            </h3>
            <p>
              For any design project alignment is a key skill. Alignment refers to the visual structure of the page. You can nearly always tell when elements haven't been aligned correctly; even to an untrained eye. A design that has been aligned correctly will look clean and will create a clear pathway through the work, making the job of the viewer much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Below is an example of instances where alignemt can be used to create a clear visual pathway. It should be clear where the viewer is being taken from the placement of all elements.

              Hierarchy
            </h3>
            <p>
              Hierarchy is another major principle in the world of graphic design. It is essential to create an order of importance within a design, so important pieces of information can easily be singled out. This helps attract and hold the viewer's attention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              As well as being used for text, hierarchy can be applied to many things. Websites show a common use of hierarchy; from the size of the navigation bar to the hero image and footer. The placement of these elements will affect the overall visual aesthetic of the design.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I began this project by looking at the different ways both alignment and hierarchy have been used in previous pieces of design. This helped give me an idea of what would visually work and what wouldn't. Before digging deeper into this project, I didn't really comprehend the depth that the subject goes into; it is truely an art in itself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The main thing I wanted to focus on was the importance of grids. Before today I didn't know that there are four types of grid in layout design. All of the grids share a similar purpose; to establish a clear linear relationship and to provide a visual structure to the page. Possibly one of the most commonly used grids is the column grid. This can be found in newspapers and magazines. The columns are used to help the content line up correctly and allow the page to flow. The more columns there are in the grid, the more flexibility you as a designer have.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Another frequently used grid is the baseline grid. This is used just as the column grid but allows for a little bit more movement. Baseline grids are usually created in 12pt increments and allow you to hang content from them. These are sometimes called washing lines as the content hangs from them vertically.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Freeform grids are less commonly used and are mainly for the odd page in a magazine or for a one off design. They have ranging lines which are indicated by an image or elements within the design. The ranging lines allow natural alignments to occur and major elements to sit aesthetically on the page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The fourth type of grid is the modular grid. This has both horizontal and vertival divisions in which content can hang from. The modules created from this grid make it much easier when laying out a large amount of content. In the 1950s and 60s, designers like Karl Gerstner and Emil Ruder developed the modular grid layout.

              Theatre production posters
            </h3>
            <p>
              The next thing I did was look at past theatre production posters. This gave me an idea of what was already out there and how different designers tackled the task. The biggest fear I had was the large amount of copy text the poster needed to include. I didn't want it to look too cluttered. I made sure to look at posters that had been designed using a variety of the grid types, this gave me a wider understanding of the subject area.

              Process
            </h3>
            <p>
              After looking into the different types of grids and theatre posters I decided to scan through the copy text and choose an order of importance for the information. This gave me a good starting point when putting the poster together.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Next I set up a column and modular grid as I thought it would give me more flexibility. Once this grid was set up I imported one of the images and began to add the copy text so I could start playing around with the composition of the elements.

              Outcome
            </h3>
            <p>
              After experimenting on Illustrator with the arrangement of elements, I came up with a final design, trying to explore the principles of alignment and hierarchy.
