          Exercise 2: Contrast & Negative Space
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              In this exercise we were asked to explore the elements of contrast and negative space in relation to magazine design. We had to create two double page spreads for a magazine. These included a splash page and a turn page. As well as only using these principles, we had to take on board what we had learned the previous week â€“ alignment and hierarchy.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              The first thing I did during this project was to look at examples of where contrast and negative space had been used in design. This gave me a good idea of what can be possible and also visually pleasing.

            <p>
             Once I had looked at contrast and negative space in general I began to look at examples of splash and turn pages. Below is an example of one I had at hand.

              Thumbnails
            </h3>
            <p>
              After I had looked at different magazine layouts I sketched a few thumbnail designs for the magazine spread. This helped get my ideas onto paper and visually see what would work.

              Outcomes
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had these ideas on paper I went over to InDesign and began putting it together on the screen. I found this process much easier as I had the thumbnails to work from. When I had completed the splash and turn pages I realised that I had only used 2 of the 3 images, so I created a second turn page to meet the requirements of the brief. Overall I am very happy with the outcomes. I tried to use all of the principles previously covered in my designs.
