          Project 3: Type Manifesto
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              This project was all about learning how to practically apply research to create our own type manifestos, informing the audience on the importance of typography. As part of this project, it was necessary to take into account the intended audience, theme, content and form of the product.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started my research by looking into different formats and types of books. I knew that I wanted mine to have an interactive element, I just wasn't quite sure what this was. I carried out my research online using websites such as pinterest for inspiration. I also used my own typography books to help inform my research. I found that quite a lot of the more interactive booklets were aimed at children so I decided that I wanted to do a similar thing. I decided that I wanted to aim my book towards children aged around 12 years old.

              Market Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              As I went into my old school every week for work experience, I thought that that would be the perfect opportunity to gather my market research. My idea was to get the students to complete some typography worksheets. This information would give me an idea of where to take the project. Before I gathered this research, I really did not know the students' past experiences with typography and obviously I didn't want the book to be above their level.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I gave them 3 activities to complete in total. The first was a worksheet about brand identity. There were six different typefaces on the sheet that they should recognise. I took them from famous and well known brands like Puma and Google. Their challenge was to identify the typeface and comment on any feelings or emotions that the typeface evoked. This went down better than I expected; it caused conversation within the class and it was interesting to hear the comments. The most common observation was how hard it was to identify them when they were in black and white. The Google typeface was the most difficult to identify.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The second activity consisted of an a3 sheet full of different typefaces. Each student had to choose a typeface that they thought represented them and their personality. This activity was well received and seemed an appropriate jump from the previous activity. The typefaces they chose from this activity would form the basis of the book.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The third activity I asked the students to complete allowed them to show their creativity and individuality. They had to write their name in any typeface and material of their choosing and then underneath explain and discuss their chosen typeface from the previous activity. These pieces of art were used to create the pages of the book.

              Constructing
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had gathered all of my market research I just needed to find a way to construct the book. Originally I wanted to create a perfectly bound book and get it sent off to be printed, however after the research into different book formats, I decided that a bound book would not really match my target audience. After looking at different possibilities I found that flip cards worked really well and they had the important interactive element I wanted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I played around with different ways to make the flip cards into a book format and found that a leaf binder ring would work the best. After that, it was just down to assembling.
            </p>

                <a href="images/vcomproj3/con2.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj3/con2small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="images/vcomproj3/con3.jpg"> <img src="images/vcomproj3/con3small.jpg"></a>
              </div>
            <p>
            Once the book was together I couldn't help but feel something was missing. I knew that I didn't want a front cover because I wanted it to keep the informal feel, but something was not right. That is when I decided to add the little sleeve with the title '8cfb type identity'. I kept the paint splats as a continuing motif to tie everything together. Overall I am very happy with the outcome. It was not what I quite expected at the beginning, but it has come out better than I could have imagined.
