          Exercise 3: Balance & Colour
        </h1>

            <p>
              This project was focussing largely on balance and colour. We were asked to create layouts for an iPad resident app. These layouts had to consist of a landing page and product page, as well as including both symmetry and asymmetry and both contrating and complementary colours.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I have had a small amount of exposure to app and web design in the past so this project was not completely foreign to me. The first thing I did was look at existing app designs. This helped me get a feel for where I wanted to go with this project. The simpler and cleaner I made the app, the more time I would have to experiment with the use of colour. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Below are some examples of app designs I found online.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The next thing I did was sketch a few layouts on paper. I tried to look at both orientations of the screen and take in to account both the landing page and product page. I ended up merging several elements from many designs together for my final layouts. I used a tool called mockflow to create these final layouts.

              Colour Palettes
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had my designs on paper I went on to the website Coolors which is a tool that generates colour palettes. As the app is advertising bikes, I tried to stick with slightly more earthy colours, appealing to both genders.

              Experiments – Contrasting/Symmetrical
            </h3>
            <p>
              Next I moved on to Photoshop and began getting my ideas on the screen. I found my transition from website design to app design very difficult at first but I found that the simpiler the design was the more it looked like an app. I stuck to two main colours in order to not over complicate the design.

              Experiments – Complementary/Asymmetrical
            </h3>
            <p>
              After the symmetrical layout I moved on to the asymmetrical one. I found this one much harder as I had more freedom to play around with the elements. Sometimes the less freedom you have the easier the project is.
