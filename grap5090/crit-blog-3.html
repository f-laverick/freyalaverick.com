          Advertising and Myth
        </h3>

            <p>
              Adverts have an importance to particular times and places. They document and convey political, social and cultural ideals. They help reinforce certain cultural myths which can be presented as natural but show a cultural norm or dominant ideology.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Adverts are used to convey moral values, including cultural norms and ways of behaviour. They show a representation of gender, class and ethnicity. They also help reinforce attitudes towards consumerism and social status. although being largely positive, creating a link between status and consumption, adverts do conceal the way in which they have been produced and their economic structure. They make sure to show what is attractive to the customer.

              Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
            </h3>
            <p>
              Abraham Maslow was an American psychologist. He is most known for creating Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. This is an idea in psychology that explores observations around humans' innate curiosity. Maslow presents the heirarchy of needs in a pyramid shape. The needs on the bottom being more basic while the needs on the top being intangible like morality and creativity.

              Magazine Adverts
            </h3>
            <p>
              The advertising business is very competitive and professional. Many companies spend high amounts of money on their brand and their advertisments. When creating an advert in a magazine, the designer will have little to no information on the content of the page opposite. This means they will spend and do whatever in order for their advert to stand out against the competition. People who work in the industry need to be on top and aware of the current political and cultural trends. Although each advert is relatively self contained, they need to reach their target audience and present a constructed message (encoding).

              Panzini Analysis

              Ren√© Magritte was a surrealist painter. The Treachery of Images was painted in 1929 and shows a romantic depiction of a pipe.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The french text translates to 'this is not a pipe'. This could be seen as a contradiction because the image clearly shows a pipe, however Magritte is trying to show us that what we see is different to the object it actually is. He once said that his painting could not be a real pipe because you cannot physically put tabacco in it. This image is an iconic signifier as it resembles the thing it is describing. In this case the plane of abstraction is the beautiffuly painted pipe. It is painted so well that it resembles a realistic pipe. Pipes give connotations to being old-fashioned, bad for your health and a status symbol.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In the case of this painting, you could say that the anchorage being used is interdependent/congergent. This is because the text and image work together in conveying the meaning and message, whilst also working separately.

              Miss Dior Analysis
            </h3>
              <div class="main">
                <img src="../images/graphy2/crit/ads/ad2.jpg"></a>

              <br>
            <p>
              This is a 2012 advert for the Miss Dior perfume, featuring Natalie Portman.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The quote 'Natalie Portman is Miss Dior' is a non-coded linguistic message alluding to the idea of a fairytale ending as well as a high end, luxurious perfume; if it is good enough for Natalie Portman, it must be good enough for everyone else.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The script style font links in with the target audience; 25-45 aged women. The overall feel has connotations to wealth and elegance. Natelie Portman is positioned sitting down leaning towards the camera against a neutral background. Having the person leaning towards the camera and looking forwards is a strategic marketing technique. We as consumers are always drawn to the face and eyes. Having a calm, almost sensual expression on the face helps to relax and engage the audience. The neutral background helps to not distract from the purpose of the advert; the importance and need for the fragrance.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              By this point the audience should be engaged with the advert. Our eyes are drawn from the person, down to the perfume bottle; the focal point of the campaign. Having the fragrance called 'Miss Dior' also links to the idea of femininity. Both the image and linguistic messages work together in portraying ideals of the brand and obligation to purchace the product.
