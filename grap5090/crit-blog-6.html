              Laura Mulvey: Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema
            </h3>
            <p>
              Laura Mulvey is a British feminist film theorist and is currently a professor of film and media studies at Birkbeck, University of London. She is most well known for her essay, 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' that was published in 1975.  
            <br>
            <br>
              By the time Mulvey wrote the essay, Hollywood cinema was very much the back drop with which she could work. In 1977, Mulvey wrote and directed the film 'Riddles of the Sphinx'. In this she explores a new feminist language within cinema that was outside the conventional narrative norms. The circular camera movements allowed the point of view to be put up for question. It also had an elegant resonance with the feminine, claustrophobic, domestic space. Women's relationship to language could be argued to be the central idea running through the film. Around this time it was thought that it was the responsibility of the director to both engage the spectator's interest and find a way of allowing the spectator to be an active participant. Now, things have changed and the owness is on the spectator to be an active participant and to engage imaginatively and poetically with the film.

              <br>
              Mulvey's shift in spectatorship came vey abruptly and out of the influence of the feminine movement. Films that she had enjoyed, she began viewing through a different lens. Rather than being captivated by the screen, by the story, by the mise-en-scene and the beauty of the language, she was distracted. Instead of being an engaged spectator; a voyeuristic spectator; a male spectator, she became a female spectator, watching the film from afar and analytically.   
              <br>
              <br>
              In the essay, Mulvey discusses the psychoanalytic concept of scopophilia with reference to modern Hollywood films. She was heavily influenced by the ideas of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. Freud seemed to offer a vocabulary and a way of thinking about gender and sexuality that was needed. Scopophilia is viewed through a phallocentric, heteronormative lens. She utilises the psychoanalytic theory 'as a political weapon' to show how 'the unconscious of patriarchal society has structured film form'. This psychoanalytic perspective provides the link between the cinematic text and the viewer and explains his fascination through the way cinematic representations interact with his culturally resolute subconscious. Mulvey argues that the classical Hollywood cinema assumes the audience is male, therefore makes sure the female is in a position of desire. She argues for the need of a shift in cinema in order to end the male orientated Hollywood system that delivers 'narrative pleasure' to a male audience. Mulvey highlights two ways in which Hollywood cinema creates pleasure. They involve the objectification and identification of an image, both conveying the mental desires of the male subject.

              <br>
              Mulvey coins the term 'male gaze' which describes the way in which women are portrayed as sexual objects for the pleasure of a male viewer. All of this is from a masculine, heterosexual perspective. In the essay, Mulvey alludes to the idea of the 'male gaze' having three perspectives; that of the man behind the camera, that of the characters within the film representation and that of the male spectator. This 'male gaze' theory is equally contrasted with the 'female gaze'. This is a term representing the gaze of a female spectator. In more modern use, the term makes reference to the persepctive of the female filmmaker and shows how a film would be different from that of a male view of the subject.

              <br>
              I am going to be looking at two films, one older and one more contemporary, to illustrate both the male and female gaze.

              The Postman Always Rings Twice
            </h3>
            <p>
              The first film I am going to look at is 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'. This is a 1946, American film, directed by Tay Garnett. It was based on the novel by James M Cain. The film follows the story of Nick Smith, a diner owner, who hires a drifter, Frank Chambers, to work at his restaurant. Frank begins an affair with Smith's wife, Cora. They conspire to kill Smith and seize his assets. This film offers a great example of the male gaze in cinema. Throughout the film, Cora Smith is portrayed as sexual, voyeuristic and is always seen from the male protagonist's perspective. It becomes clear that the male protagonist desires Cora and views her as sexually attractive. The camera movements within the film help support the idea that Cora is a desirable object. From the first few scenes, the camera pans closely over Cora's body, showing her with all her allure.   
            <br>
            <br>
              In many ways, the character of Cora is inseperable from the male desire and gaze. Although she helps to carry the story forward, she is fundamentally in a man's world and could be seen to be ill-fated from the beginning.

              Things to Come
            </h3>
            <p>
              Although you would think the female gaze should be the opposite of the male gaze, it is a bit more complicated than this. I believe that the female gaze could be thought of as a subjective camera that tries to get inside the protagonist. It uses the camera frame to show the feelings of the character in a personal way. The camera takes on the occasionally impossible task of showing the audience how it feels to be the object of the gaze; it shows how it feels to be seen.    
            <br>
            <br>
              The example I have chosen to look at, I believe could be seen as an example of the female gaze. 'Things to Come' is a film by French director, Mia Hansen Love. The film is about a middle-aged philosophy professor whose domestic life begins to fall apart when her husband leaves her and her emotionally demanding mother dies. This film is an honest portrayal of a woman, who is thrust into a future she knew was coming but wasn't ready for. Isabelle Huppert plays the lead character of Nathalie, who has a kind of confidence that prevents her from falling into the caricature of a victim or avenger. In the film there are many shots of Huppert's character seen walking from a distance. This could convey the film's narrative, heading uninterrupted into the future. It shows the character as a person and not as an object to be viewed, and mimics the double consciousness felt by most women; living their lives while also watching them be lived. Nathalie is a woman who has been freed of the constraints of her previous life; her marriage, her family. She now has the freedom to move forward, 'I have never been so free'.
