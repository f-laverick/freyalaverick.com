              5 Essay Writing Tips
            </h3>
            <p>
              1) Use quality sources     
              <br>
              – Books
              <br>
              – Google Scholar
              <br>
              – One Search
              <br>
              <br>
              2) Know what to say
              <br>
              – When writing an essay, make sure your personality comes through
              <br>
              – Consider your own stance in order to make a balanced argument
              <br>
              – Evaluate a range of perspectives and make your own informed judgement
              <br>
              – Shape your argument before you write it
              <br>
              <br>
              3) Hone your structure
              <br>
              – Make sure you create a clear plan to follow (trello?)
              <br>
              – Introduction - 5/10% of word count. Broad overview, summarise key points
              <br>
              – Main Body - Chain of paragraphs, each containing a key point. Make sure that each paragraph links to create a flow to the essay
              <br>
              – Conclusion - 10/15% of word count. Summarise key points made and come up with a final answer to the question
              <br>
              <br>
              4) Draft then redraft
              <br>
              – Draft, review, then edit
              <br>
              – Edit the content - you only want relevent information in the essay - stay to the point
              <br>
              – Have a logical structure to the essay - do all paragraphs link?
              <br>
              – Proofread to make sure the essay is clear and to the point
              <br>
              – Point, Evidence, Explain
              <br>
              <br>
              5) Polish your tone
              <br>
              – Try to avoid first and second person (you and I)
              <br>
              – Tackle the tone in the second draft while you edit
              <br>
              – Aim for a similar style to which you see in readings
              <br>
              – Make use of the Academic Phrasebook
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="subtitle-ses1">
              Referencing
            </h3>
            <p>
              You should reference a source every time you: 
              <br>
              – Directly quote from a source
              <br>
              – Paraphrase from a source
              <br>
              – Refer to a visual source
              <br>
              <br>
              You must be clear what is your work and what is not
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="subtitle-ses1">
              Citations

              I feel reasonably happy with my essay writing skills. It has been about three years since I last wrote a proper essay, so I know I have a lot to remember. I have always found forming an argument quite hard but this should be good practice for the dissertation. To overcome my weaknesses I will make sure I have a very detailed plan so I know exactly what I want to say. I am also going to make sure to check frequently that everything I write relates back to the title.
