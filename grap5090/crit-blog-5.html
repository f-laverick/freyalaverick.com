              Subculture is a term that dates back to the 1800's. Early studies have reffered to it as a deviant group or an urban underclass. The prefix 'sub' suggests a lower rank (subordinate/subterranean). It is also associated with the post 1945 youth subcultures; including the rise of the teenager. It was defined as a minority group who rebel and stand apart from the parent/mainstream culture. A mainstream culture is the organisation of a society into hierarchal structures that are shaped by prominent media, social and corporate interests. It refelcts the ideas/interests of powerful social groups. Dick Hebdige is a British media theorist and sociologist who argues that 'a subculture...signals a breakdown of consensus'. In his 1979 book 'Subculture: The Meaning of Style', he also argues that a subculture brings together people who feel neglected by society's expectations and allow them to develop a sense of identity.

              An example of a subculture is 'Hippies'. Hippies are usually regarded as a contra culture, this is a radical form of subculture. It rejects vaules often accepted by society. The movement really began during the 1960's in America. The word 'hippe' came from the word 'hip', which was a term applied to the Beats of the 1950's. They began to craete their own communities and listened to psychedelic music, favoured longer hair and unconventional dress. Hippes often felt isolated from middle-class society, which was dominated by materialism and and repression. They usually took up communal living arrangements, preffered a vegan/vegetarian diet and practiced holistic medicine. 'Make love, not war' became a popular phrase associated with the subculture as they were not advocates of violence and war. They practiced Buddhism and other Eastern religions.

              Gloria Steinem helped the subculture become a real movement. Steinem is an American feminist journalist and political activist. She is regarded as a leader of the feminist movement in the late 60s and 70s and to this day. Steinem helped give people, especially women, a voice and influenced those around her. Other forces within the movement include Michelle Phillips, Carly Simon, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Janis Joplin.
