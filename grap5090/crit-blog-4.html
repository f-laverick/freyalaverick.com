          Session 4: Graphic Code of Comic Books
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Comics books contain a set of graphic signs which are used to tell a story. These signs are unique to comic strips and are easily accepted and understood. Comics consist of many elements, some of which include panels, the gutter, speech bubbles, sound effects, symbolic icons and character abstraction. Comics can be used to inform, persuade and engage the reader.

              Encoding and Decoding
            </h3>
            <p>
              Encoding involves cognitive reasoning in the selection, arrangement and layout of textual and visual elements that make up the narrative. Decoding alludes to the ways in which comic strips rely on the reader to understand and make links (anchorage) between the written and visual information. It also allows the reader to follow the actions between one panel and the next.
              <br>
              Comics are a unique storytelling form which allow the past, present and future to be shown on one page at one time. This can mean that the focus of the reader can be erratic and confused as they have to constantly transverse and rewind across the page. To help avoid these difficulties controlled strategies have been introduced to avoid confusion.

              Control Strategies
            </h3>
            <p>
              Page Layout - A page skeleton can be used to encourage an appreciation of the creative process. This helps focus the eye on more important parts of the page.
              <br>
              <br>
              Panel Co-ordinates - A panel has a relation to adjacent panels and other panels in the multiframe. Key co-ordinates on the page include entry and exit points and the centre. These are used to punctuate the narrative.
              <br>
              <br>
              Negative Space - Each page only shows a part of the story content. The negative space acts as a surrogate for the hidden parts. The reader has to use their imagination and creative liscence in order to fill in the gaps.

              McCloud's Transition Types 
            </h3>
            <p>
              Below are six panel to panel transitions as suggested by Scott McCloud.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Moment to moment - Small lapses in time (little closure needed)
              <br>
              Action to action - Different actions/same scene (some closure needed)
              <br>
              Subject to subject - Different subjects/same scene or idea (needs more reader involvement to work)
              <br>
              Scene to scene - Geographical location, significant movement of time and or space (deductive reasoning needed)
              <br>
              Aspect to aspect - Scene setting, no clear change in time. Shows different aspects of the same scene
              <br>
              Non-sequitur - No logical relationship between the panels 
            </p>

              Dave Gibbons
            </h3>
            <p>
              I chose to look at the comic book artist Dave Gibbons. He is a British comics artist and writer, born in London. Gibbons is most well known for his collaborations with writer Alan Moore, which include Watchmen and the Superman story, For the Man Who Has Everything.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I decided to look at Watchmen in a bit more detail. Watchmen ia an American comic book series. It was published in 1986 and collected into a single volume in 1987. It tells the story of an aternative history where superheros and their presence helped change hostory so that the US won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Gibbons uses a nine panel grid system throughout the series. He also uses running motifs throughout, the most common being a blood-stained smiley face. One interpretation of the face is that the blood (in an arrow shape) represents a clock, with an implied connection to the Doomsday Clock.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The section I have chosen to look at is taken from the first chapter of the comic. It shows the two detectives leaving a crime scene, agreeing to continue their work discreetly. One of them mentions the Keene Act of 1977 that outlawed "costumed adventuring". The next page shows a man wearing a trench coat and hat in an empty street. He takes out a grappling hook and scales the wall into the dead comedians apartment. I annotated a double spread from the comic series and applied McCloud's transition types to it.
