              Global Culture
            </h3>
            <p>
              Global culture can be described as a set of shared experiences and ideas that unite individuals at a global level. Mike Featherstone described it as "a space or field made possible through improved means of communication in which different cultures meet and clash". Globalisation has two main inter-linking themes. The global village and trade without borders. Martin Albrow describes the global village as "the whole earth as the physical environment where all citizens, consumers and producers, possessed of a common-sense interest in collective action to solve global problems." The global village consists of the entire world being connected as a result of advancements in technology. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Trade without borders shows a movement in the west from manufacturing to service based economies. Klein believed that the growth in corporations could be traced back to the 1980's due to trade liberalization, union reforms and global economies. This marked the movement from production to branding. Tom Peters described this change as "lumpy object purveyors to players in brainware".

            <p>
              The anti-corporate movement had seen a wide growth since the early 1990's due to growing awareness and anti-consumerism. Design started being used as a weapon of propaganda, subversion and culture jamming. I Will be looking at an artist who's political views are clear in his work.

              Ai Weiwei â€“ Sunflower Seeds
            </h3>
            <p>
              Ai Weiwei is a contemporary Chinese artist and activist. He has been very critical of the Chinese Government's thoughts towards democracy and human rights. In 2010 the Tate Museum in London displayed Ai's Sunflower Seeds. This work consisted of 100 million hand crafted and painted sunflower seeds. Each seed was induvudual and no two were the same. Ai uses this work to allow the audience to rethink the 'Made in China' phenomenon and express his views on Chinese politics. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The sea of seeds represent the Chinese people; each one being individual and seemingly powerless, but when together, create a sense of unity and strength. The main idea being that if the people of China stand united, that they could overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. It is also thought that the seeds represent the ever growing issues surrounding mass production in China and the labor-intensive methods of creating products.
