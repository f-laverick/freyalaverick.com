              In this weeks session we looked at the different kinds of research methods and their importance. We also began looking at key points needed when writing an essay and how to construct a well rounded argument.

              Anti Modernism
            </h3>
            <p>
              Anti modernism was believed to be the 'reason (modernism) has been shaped by a dishonest pursuit of certainty' - Lyotard. It shows a complex reatcion to the failures of modernism and an anti-foundational rejection of rationalism, truths, certainty and unstable belief systems. It is a questioning of the ideological bias of all history and knowlege and reflects scepticism towards the grand political schemes of modernism. A few examples include contradictory attitudes to modern media (fake news), feminist anti 'patriarchal' perspectives, and no rules - subversion of modernist ideals.

              Hyper Modernism
            </h3>
            <p>
              'In an amazing acceleration...postmodernism is not modernism at its end but in the nascent state, and this state is constant' - Lyotard. Hyper-modernism is cyclical and runs in tandem with post-modernism. It shows technological determinism and an acceleration of cultural hybridity.

              Will Gompertz - What Are You Looking At
            </h3>
            <p>
              I decided to look at a chapter from Gompertz' book 'What Are You Looking At'. Gompertz is the BBC's art editor and the previous director of Tate media. He has written for the Guardian and the Times newspaper and is a well established author.
              <br>  
              <br>
              In the book, Gompertz looks at how something as simple as a urinal has helped change our perception of what art is and that art is not constricted by a canvas or piece of paper. In chapter 19, Gompertz goes on to look at and compare different pieces of post-modernist art. He looks at Cindy Sherman in detail, explaining how her work reflects celebrities and the medias influence on public image and the way they are percieved; they show what we want to see. Gompertz also looks at Jeff Wall's recreation of Delacriox' 'The Death of Sardanapalus'. He points out the similarities between the colour palettes, light and composition. Both pieces however, look nothing alike and are focused around different subject matters. 'Both images portray a once optimistic and herioc society in a state of disenchantment and decay'.

              Below is my annotated copy of the chapter.
