          Session 8: Fashion Editorial Storytelling
        </h1>

              Although unlikely, fashion photography from the past to the present day is an uncommon form of 'art history'. Fashion photography has been another way to capture a moment in another world; a screenshot in time. These pictures help to create a story, drawing the viewer in to the article. If the images are weak, so will be the story, therefore the whole narrative will have no body or meaning.

              Art directors tend to be the people directing the photographers and organising the shoot. In order to create a unique narrative, the art director must have a clear vision of the world they want to create. Photography is not quite as simple as taking a nice picture. Both the photographer and art director will have to take in to account the lighting, mood, theme, setting and hair and makeup among many other things.

              Through the fashion magazine 'Vogue', the audience have been made aware of the visual culture due to the attitude towards editorial fashion and storytelling.

            Like mentioned, all photographs in a magazine have a narrative, through the setting, form and subject, they are able to tell a story. Good photographers are able to capture a world in a single shot. This eight page spread may seem disconnected, but each photograph will have been carefully planned and choreographed so that the narrative can flow between each page. Above, we can see female models in an empty, almost clinical environment, this motif of setting is a constant throughout the spread. Each article is quite dull with muted, drained tones, however, in every photograph, there is a pop of colour, this helps connect the story and keeps it exciting. Another commonality between the photographs is the positioning of the model. In each spread, a particular device has been used so that the models are positioned in such a way as to make to pages connect. In this case it has been symmetry. In each page the models are either looking towards or away from one another creating a sense of visual flow. The first two photographs in this spread have been very carefully positioned and create real dynamic at the beginning of the narrative. Having the models leaning away from each other creates an almost circular composition, pleading the reader to turn the page. The second and third page spread shows the models at either ends of the composition, in essence, balancing it out. This helps set the scene and gives meaning to the story. The final pages have been  incredibly well planned. Both models are sharing the same table which flows between the two pages. Each model is also facing one another, this helps to close the narrative, having them positioned towards the center of the pages almost makes the audience want to close the magazine, thus, ending the story.

            All magazines and fashion stories have intended audiences. Some magazines may be aimed towards a younger audience, while others will be aimed towards a more mature market. Magazines also come in different genres, lifestyle magazines may use a gender profile in order to attract the audience. If it is a women's lifestyle magazine, it will include female fashion and culture rather than mens. Other magazines may be intended for a wider, less specific audience, so will often use models that are not known in the media, and use settings that are neutral. This helps create a wider link to a larger audience. At the other end, some magazines will be targeted towards a more wealthy and almost elite demographic. Many celebrity magazines are targeted at a younger audience, with the 'up to date' fashion trends and newest scandals of the famous faces among Hollywood.

            The magazine that I chose to look at was the WSJ magazine. This magazine originated in the US in 2008 after it had become apparent that there was a gap in the market for luxury magazines. The Wall Street Journal includes luxury products and is only issued to those who have subscribed. The magazine is in circulation around the world, but largely in the US, Europe and Asia.

            The spread I chose above features actress and activist Julianne Moore. Having the magazine feature a celebrity of such status immediately narrows the audience and heightens the expectation. All photographs used are of a high quality, increasing the sense of luxuriousness. Each photo above is lit in such a way as to create a strong sense of chiaroscuro, this contrast of light and dark creates a sense of depth and gives a three dimensional feel. The photographs which have been kept in colour will have had to have been carefully planned in order to accentuate certain features. In this case, Moore's red hair was key. The stylist will have picked colours and textures to help exaggerate both her hair and her natural beauty. The bronze and crimson of the dresses are strong, but do not overpower the composition. In the spread above, the use of both chiaroscuro and colour help to highlight the form and beauty of the photograph without taking away from the subject itself.
