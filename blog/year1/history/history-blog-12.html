              During the 1980's, Britain had a conservative government ran by the first female prime minister; Margaret Thatcher. During her period as prime minister, Thatcher introduced many new policies that eventually became known as Thatcherism. Put simply, Thatcherism was the belief in a small state and free market. It was a move away from society, towards a more mobile economy. Thatcher was an extremely complex and intensely both loved and reviled character, she certainly implemented huge change in Britain. She was this almost totemic figure of the late twentieth century; she was a saint to some and a monster to others. During the 1980's, Britain witnessed a large rate of unemployment that resulted from Thatcher's monetarist policies.

              The 1980's also saw a great cultural divide; the official and unofficial cultures. The official culture was mainstream and internationally targeted, while the unofficial culture was a rebellion against the Thatcherite zeitgeist, it was small scale and urban centred. This divide gave the younger generation a way to express themselves through fashion, music, design and technology.
