          Project 2: Two Dimensional Design

            <p>
              This project was all about two dimensional design. It was split into three sections in which we were asked to create a zine covering a certain topic. Before starting this project I was totally new to zines so I knew I would be out of my comfort zone.

              Zine 1: Pandemic
            </h3>
            <p>
              For this zine we were given the word 'pandemic' and asked to create a zine responding to that word using only typography and letterforms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was research what a zine actually was. 'Zines are cheaply made printed forms of expression on any subject. They are like mini-magazines or home-made comic books about favourite bands, funny stories and sub-cultures'.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
              Once I had got to grips with what a zine actually was I looked into the different formats zines could be. These varied from the accordion to a bound zine.

            <br>
            <p>
              After I had looked at different forms of zines I began experimenting with typography. This consisted of scanning and photocopying, tracing and digitally rendered type. It was important that I showed the chaos that surrounded the word 'pandemic'.

              After further experimentation, I began to layout the pages of the zine and started to put it together. Below is my final outcome.

              Zine 2: Migration
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              For the second zine we were asked to explore the word 'migration' using only images. These could be found or sourced images. I sourced the large majority of the images myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Once I knew this zine consisted purely of images I did some research into photographers I admire. The thing that they had in common was the use of black and white photography. There is a certain power and emotion that black and white photography captures and given that our word was 'migration', I thought that this style would be the most appropriate. I looked at Magnum photos and Jessica Lange as my main sources of inspiration.

              I knew I wanted my zine to be made up of black and white photography but I wasn't sure on the context of each photo. I decided that my take on migration would be about travel. This allowed me to cover a wider subject area.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I started off by gathering some images that I had taken already and made a small mock up of an accordion style zine.

              Once I had finished this zine I couldn't help but think something was missing. I decided to experiment with printing on to different mediums, the main one being tracing paper. I really like the effect this gave but I was still not quite happy. I gathered more images and started printing on to 160gsm hot pressed paper. This gave the subtlety that I was trying to achieve.

              Zine 3: Union
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              The last zine consisted of both type and image. We were given the word 'union' and asked to work in partners to create our outcomes. All graphic designers were partnered with an illustrator so we could combine our skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              My partner and I decided to explore the word 'union' through the theme of feminism. We chose a feminist that we both admired and our zine became a kind of timeline of her life. We documented some key moments in her life that may be recognisable to the viewer. We used the accordion method to convey this as it fit with the timeline theme. Half of the zine was a combination of illustration and type while the other half was focussing solely on photography. We found that this combined our strengths well and we managed to communicate our ideas effectively.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The first thing we had to do when creating the zine was researching our chosen feminist. We chose to research Gloria Steinem, an American activist, journalist and feminist. We used the internet, her website and her book as main points of research. Then we chose 4 key moments in her life to document. These were the magazine that Steinem founded, the Women's Media Center in which she was a founder, films and documentaries she worked on and all the awards she won. We used a variety of techniques to achieve our outcome. This included painting, scanning and editing using photoshop.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The back of the zine consisted of 4 photographs, also documenting her life. We decided to print black and white to add to the atmosphere of each image. I printed them on to a3 acetate to add to the documented feel. Overall we are both very happy with the outcome of the zine, we worked well as a team and I believe that shows through our final product.
