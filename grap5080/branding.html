              For this project we would be working in groups of 4. Each group was given a city and we had to come up with branding to promote the city. We were acting as a design consultancy, bidding for our city to be the City of Culture 2025.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once we had been given our groups and cities we began the research stage. My group were given the city of Bath. Before beginning this project I knew very little about the city apart from the fact it has beautiful architecture and is known for its literary figures.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              We split the research into different sections to make it easier. These were location, history, industry, culture and architecture. We had to collate our research and create a pdf to present at a later date. Below is the link to our presentation.

              Once we had completed our presentation, I went on to look at other branding designs, especially those aimed at cities and places. This helped me get an idea how other people have tackled a similar brief. I like a lot of the more simple, minimal designs, with subtle use of colour.

              Early Ideas to Explore
            </h3>
            <p>
              During the research into our city, we found that Bath is possibly most well known for the Roman Baths and its iconic architecture. Architecture has been a passion of mine for many years, and as it has such strong connections to Bath, it is a route we would be likely to explore further. We also found out that Bath is a hub of literary figure, some of which being Jane Austen, Mary Shelley and Charles Dickens. As Bath has the Jane Austen Centre and attracts many tourists for this reason, it is another avenue we thought about exploring. Below are moodboards exloring architecture and literature in Bath.

              Architecture
            </h3>
            <p>
              With regards to architecture, I took the topic from two different directions. I began looking at the different architectural features in more detail, this involved the Classical orders as seen on the Circus, to the fan vaulting seen on the Abbey. I then started looking at some of the popular architectural landmarks within the city. These ranged from Pulteney Bridge to the Royal Crescent.

            <p>
              Once I had looked into different approaches to city branding, our group began getting some ideas onto paper. These acted as a good starting point for developing our logo. Below are some of our groups initial logo sketches.

              Logo Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              When all of our ideas had been aired, we split up and each developed our individual ideas further. We then met up and chose one of the ideas to take forward. Below shows our journey from planning to finalising the logo.
              <br>
              <br>
              After much debate we decided that we wanted to exploit the architectural side of the city. We explored several ideas including incorporating the Crescent, using the Gothic trefoil shape and intergrating the Abbey in some way. We wanted to use an older style serif typeface to allude to the Roman aspects. Adam had the idea to try and make the 'h' of Bath into the shape of the Abbey. We experimented with colour and layout until we were happy with our outcome.

              We decided to brand for different events that occur in the city. This would attract a range of visitors. We made posters for each event. We all went away and began mocking up the posters individually. I think at times we all got a bit confused, but managed to help each other. Below shows our development journey. (Click to expand)

              Reflection

            <p>
              Overall I found this project quite difficult. I enjoyed the topic but found the group work a bit hard as we did not spread the workload evenly. I feel like we got a bit lost at times. If I were to do this project again, I would go back to my original idea that was not brought forward and look further into the architectural side of the city. I feel like this needed to be exploited more.
