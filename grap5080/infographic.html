              For our last project of the semester we were asked to create an infographic on any topic that interests us. We had to research and collect data to then present in an informative but engaging way.

            <p>
              The first thing I did during this project was to do some research into types and themes of infographics. Prior to this project, I knew very little about infographics. I found that there are many forms including visual, list based, map, statistical, animated and many more. I looked at the website 'Information is Beautiful' and was captured by many of the examples on there. I was interested in the animated form of infographic but knew that if I chose to go down this path, it would be a huge learning curve.
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are some examples of infographics I found online.

              Theme – Shakespears Sister
            </h3>
            <p>
              For a long time music has heavily influenced my life. Once I knew that in this project we were able to pick our own topics, I knew I wanted to look at music. 
              <br>
              <br>
              One band that I have always found very interesting is Shakespears Sister. They are an alternative pop and rock musical duo that was formed in 1988, featuring Siobhan Fahey and Marcella Detroit. I think the thing that really stood out to me about this duo is that they used their music as a way to cultivate their own differences. They were never products of the time, they seem to stand slightly outside what was going on. They each come from very opposing musical and cultural backgrounds, with very contrasting vocals which became a defining part of their sound. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Another thing that I noticed about the band was the visual aesthetic. Many of their music videos were directed by Sophie Muller. The pair were heavily influenced by the films 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane' and 'Sunset Boulevard' and that classic old Hollywood vibe of the deranged diva and the embattled woman. 'Hormonally Yours' was the duo's second album together. It was created as a concept album that was an almost soundtrack to the 50s B-film 'Cat-Women of the Moon'. The content of many of the music videos was derived from the films plot. For instance, the single 'Stay', which stayed at no. 1 in the UK Charts for 8 weeks, was influenced by the film. The video featured Detroit and Fahey as catwomen who were fighting over this earthling character. 
              <br>
              <br>
              As well as being known for their music, Shakespears Sister is almost as well known for their visuals. Sophie Muller exploited the difficulties between Detroit and Fahey in order to create groundbreaking pieces of art. She plays on the pairs mutual paranoia and insecurities and manages to create very real, honest videos. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The duo are infamously known for their 26 year feud. After years of working together, the pair split up in 1996, due to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Detroit and Fahey didn't speak for over 26 years until they were ready to repair their friendship and finally understand and forgive each other. Eventually they ended up realising how similar they were and how they still had that creative spark together. In 2018, the pair got together and were able to create new music with a new appreciation and respect for each other. The music video for one of their latest singles 'All the Queen's Horses', was directed by Sophie Muller. Muller was able to rekindle the iconic aesthetic of Shakespears Sister whilst also mocking their struggled relationship. The video is cleverly constructed, with flashbacks to previous videos. This helped to create a link back to times before the split and acts as a reminder of what has not been lost. Muller shows a sense of healing whilst conveying the drama that occured between the pair.
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are some pictures and videos of the iconic duo.

              Siobhan Fahey
            </h3>
            <p>
              Siobhan Fahey was born in Dublin in 1958 and is a singer and musician. She was a former member of the girl group, Bananarama, but left in 1988 to pursue her own musical style and created Shakespears Sister. She joined the original members of Bananarama in 2017 for their UK tour.  
              <br>
              <br>
              Siobhan's inspiration came from many places. After spending so long working in a girl group, it took Fahey longer to identify her own style. She has been influenced by varied and diverse artists from Echo and the Bunnymen to The Smiths, to Bowie and Giorgio Moroder. Fahey began Shakespears Sister in 1988 as a solo act, but it was later suggested her and Detroits voices would pair well together. This meeting of light and shade was very new of its time and still feels fresh today.

              Marcella Detroit (Levy)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Marcella Detroit was born in Detroit in 1952 and is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. She co-wrote 'Lay Down Sally' with Eric Clapton in 1977 and joined Shakespears Sister in 1989. After leaving the band in 1993, Detroit produced her own music and had a UK top 20 hit with 'I Believe' in 1994. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Marcella was raised in suburban Detroit, growing up around Folk Blues and Motown. From an early age she was interested in instruments, learning the violin, guitar, harmonica and keyboard very young. She has always had a very purist approach to music. When Detroit moved to LA, she began to do a lot of R&B and Soul session work for people like Aretha Franklin and George Duke.

              Initial Ideas
            </h3>
            <p>
              My initial idea for this project surrounded the feud and rift between the pair. I thought it would be interesting to try and visually represent the duo's journey, following the good and difficult times. I believe that the band are misunderstood, however their music still stands on its own today. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I thought about trying to represnt this journey through an animated infographic. I think that the animated form will convey this story effectively. I also like the idea of making it as a timeline as it will be following the band from the very beginning. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are some examples of timeline infographics which have helped inform my decisions.

              History
            </h3>
            <p>
              – Shakespears Sister was formed in 1988 in London by Siobhan Fahey (former Bananarama). 
              <br>
              – Became a duo in 1989 when Marcella Detroit joined. 
              <br>
              – Siobhan Fahey left Bananarama in 1988 due to disillusionment with the groups musical direction.
              <br>
              – In 1988 Fahey began writing with Richard Feldman, who later suggested working with Detroit who is known for her collaborations with Eric Clapton.
              <br>
              – Detroit has written songs for Eric Clapton as well as herself and Shakespears Sister and is an accomplished singer and instrumentalist, being able to play the guitar, harmonica and keyboard.
              <br>
              – The name Shakespears Sister comes from The Smiths song, with the intentional misspelling.
              <br>
              – The debut single 'Break My Heart' was intended to differentiate Fahey's work from Bananarama and her new band. After Fahey and Detroit's cooperation on this album it was decided that Detroit would become a real member and less of a backing singer.
              <br>
              – The second single 'You're History' was released in 1989 as a way of presenting the act as a duo.
              <br>
              – 'Stay' was a song released in 1992 by the duo. This single stayed in the UK Charts at no. 1 for 8 weeks. This song is probably the duo's most well known song to date and was inspired by the B-movie 'Cat-Women of the Moon'. 
              <br>
              – 'I Don't Care', from the album 'Homornally Yours' peaked at no. 7 in the UK Charts.
              <br>
              – Detroit was dismissed from the band in 1993 due to mutual paranoia and misunderstandings.
              <br>
              – Fahey took at break from the band until 1996 due to personal issues. In 1996, Fahey returned with the new single 'I Can Drive'.
              <br>
              – In 2010, Shakespear Sister returned as a solo act and completed a ten date UK tour.
              <br>
              – In 2018, after over 26 years of silence, Fahey and Detroit met up to resolve their differences. This resulted in a new respect and appreciation towards each other.
              <br>
              – After their reconcilliation, the pair went to Joshua Tree and created new music together. One of their latest songs 'All the Queen's Horses' represents this new relationship, while also remembering it's roots.
              <br>
              – In 2019, the duo announced that they would retunite on stage in a UK tour titled 'Ride Again'.

              Intentions - Further Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              After much research into the band and their history, I decided that I wanted to aim the infographic at an audience with little prior knowledge of them. This would mean that I would focus more on the history, journey and relationship of the members and the band itself. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I became aware that I was possibly too invested in the topic, and was looking at what I found interesting, not what others would want to learn. I took a step back at this point and asked for other people's opinions. I asked about six different people if they had heard of the band and what they would like to find out about them. After these discussions, I found most people had some memory of the band, but in no great detail. The feedback I got was that most people were less interested in the statistics of the songs and were more interested in the journey and relationship. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I found this extra research very helpful as it helped me to understand, on average, what people wanted to know - not just what I wanted to show.

              Possible Imagery 
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had a clear picture of the direction in which this project was going, I began to collect some images and videos together that may be useful. As my aim is to show the relationship and journey of the duo, I needed to be very selective in the imagery used. I looked for material that showed their history; mapping it from the beginning through to now. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are some of the images/videos that I may use.

              Initial Ideas
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had collected a few images, I began to plan out the order of the infographic. As I wanted mine to be interactive, I needed to plan it slightly differently to show each eventuality. I knew this would be a long process and many of my initial ideas would change so I used post it notes to illustrate the flow of the infographic. This allowed me to quickly add and move things around when I needed to.  
              <br>
              <br>
              When I was reasonably happy with the rough order of elements, I went on to mocking up some initial user flows. This helps me to visualise what the end product will look like and how the elements will interact with one another.

              Style Tests/Exploration
            </h3>
            <p>
              In order to create a consistent piece of design, it was important that I tested some initial ideas. This would save me time trying out styles and colours at a later date. I decided on the most important elements of the design and explored the limitations of each. I wanted to look at image treatment, type choice and creating an interactive code.

              Image Treatment
            </h3>
            <p>
              After I had decided on a rough order for the information, I went on to exploring how to achieve a similar style to that of the band. Many of the music videos were inspired by old Hollywood films like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and Sunset Boulevard. The videos contain both colour and black and white imagery so I decided to play around with some different ideas until I was happy with the outcome.  
              <br>
              <br>
              I looked at black and white imagery as well as colour. I also applied different filters and textures to the images in order to try and achieve a similar effect. I played with the idea of having a slightly different style at the beginning and the end to represent the change in time and the evolved relationship. Below are my ideas for image treatment.

              Type Choice
            </h3>
            <p>
              An important part of any identity is the choice of typeface. Shakespears Sister use a very particular typeface, which becomes instantly recognisable to fans/audience. This typeface is usually paired with a deep red colour which is something I may carry through the design. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I started looking at how this main typeface could be paired with a secondary typeface and possibly a third for the body copy. I tried different styles and used the signiture red colour. Below are my ideas for type choice.

              Interactive Elements
            </h3>
            <p>
              I decided quite early on that I wanted this design to be interactive. I felt this style would work well with the topic choice, as I am trying to convey a journey/relationship which is ever evolving. I liked the idea of the design moving to show this. The technology required to achieve my ideas is still very new to me so I tested out a few different ideas.  
              <br>
              <br>
              I tested out how different elements would react to one another and how the interactive part would convey the story being told. Below are my ideas for the interactive elements.
