              During the 1960s, the long held values and social norms of the time seemed to break down, especially with this newer, fresher, younger generation. Young men and women became political activists and were the driving force behind many anti war movements. Attitudes towards sexuality loosened and women began to protest against the traditional female roles.

              As well as activism, the art culture was also affected. This included rock music, spirituality and pop art. Some of the influential figures in this field consisted of Wes Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Rick Griffin, Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley.
