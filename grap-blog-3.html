              For this project, we were originally asked to create a 30 second animation that showed the plot of our favourite book or film. Due to unforeseen circumstances we were given a different brief. The essence of this brief was the same; portraying the plot of our favourite book or film, however rather than doing so with an animation, we were asked to show the plot using 10 pictures. These pictures would then be posted to social media. The film I chose was The Fabulous Baker Boys.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I decided that as we had a little bit longer on this project than we previously thought, that I would try to create an animation. Before doing this project, animation was a completely new world to me. I appreciated them, but had no real interest in them.

              I remember a few years ago, being showed the music video to 'Take On Me' by A-Ha. There was something so magical about this video that just captivated me. From that point, I have always been fascinated by it. The style seemed so ahead of its time, yet really, it was quite simple.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I watched that video a few times to get the feel for it and then stumbled across a documentary about it (a-ha The Making of Take On Me). This documentary starred the animation directors Candace Reckinger and Michael Patterson and explained the animation process. The technique used was rotoscoping. This involves tracing over captured footage frame by frame in order to create a live action animation. I thought that this would be the perfect technique to use, both for the film I chose and as an introduction to animation.

              The next thing I did was look into how I would actually create this rotoscope using the software I had. I wanted to use Photoshop because that is what I am most used to, and not knowing how long the animation would take, I thought it was important to stick with what I knew.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              After looking into how I would create a rotoscope using Photoshop, it became clear that the first thing I needed was a video. This would become the basis of the animation. I found a copy of The Fabulous Baker Boys and converted the file to a mp4. This would allow me to edit it on Photoshop.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The animation needed a beginning, middle and end. I rewatched the film and thought of scenes that were iconic to each part. I then found these scenes in Photoshop and trimmed them down so I ended up with three separate videos. In the end, I actually ended up with four clips because I used two different scenes for the beginning part.

              The film follows two brothers who have performed together for years. They encounter problems due to their lack of determination. The brothers decide to audition singers with the hope that their problems will be fixed. They choose the tough talking Susie Diamond as their singer. The new trio sees much success but the building tension may start to cause problems.

            <p>
              The scenes I chose to cover were the audition scenes, the piano scene and the end scene. I felt that these scenes condensed the plot of the film. I wanted to show a clear beginning, middle and end.

              Once I had edited the clips, the next stage was drawing over the top of the images. I set the video to 5 frames per second. This meant I had over 160 frames to draw over. I used the pen tool to create smooth tapered lines. I outlined the main features in each frame. I also used the onion skin setting so I could see the frame before. This meant the next frame I was drawing would not be too different to the one before. This was a very long process, but the outcome was definitely worth it.

            <br>
            <p>
              I encountered a few technical difficulties along the way, the main being how I would make everything work using Photoshop as most people used Premiere Pro. I ended up adapting to every situation as it arose, I may not have done it the correct way, but I made it work.

            <br>
            <p>
              Once the animation was together, I played it all the way through to see if I needed to make any amendments. The only real thing I wanted to change was the very end frame when Susie Diamond walks away. It looked like something was missing. After watching a video on how to add fading text I decided that this was the answer. I needed to add a new frame and tween it with the previous frames. This meant that the text would gradually fade in, filling the empty space.
