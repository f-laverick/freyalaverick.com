              The Bauhaus was an art school in Germany, founded by Walter Gropius in 1919. The school only ran for 14 years, however during this time, the school was able to make a huge impact on art and design today.

            <p>
              The school was created to train a new generation of artists and teach them about all aspects of art and design. During their time at the school, the students were obliged to undertake a no artistic subject as a way to enhance their learning. Many have seen the Bauhaus as an extension of the Arts and Crafts movement in 1898, as both movements aimed to revive the practise of craftsmanship. The Bauhaus wanted to create a visual vocabulary of the arts, encouraging many artistic techniques through the use of industrial technology. In all, the Bauhaus aimed to unify art and technology.

            <p>
              Each department in the school was managed by the 'Master' of that subject. Gropius thought it imperative to appoint the greatest artists in their given fields to teach and inspire the students. Gropius believed that by doing this, he could help overcome the division between art and artisan.

              The Haus am Horn was the first example of Bauhaus architecture, used to demonstrate the ideals of the school and their thoughts about modern living. The Haus am Horn was a functional house built by the school, to show effective ways of living. When designed and built, everything was built around the central living room. This was because a core concept at the time was that behind every design stood a human, and in this case the humans are key. This house aimed to bridge the gap between the upper and lower classes, making it accessible to everyone.

              The Bauhaus experienced some trouble during the 1924 elections and by 1925 the school's budgets were cut. This caused many problems, the main being the move to Dessau. Although demoralising, everyone tried to see the move as an opportunity to work harder and produce better, more original designs. In 1927, Walter Gropius resigned due to the resentment towards the school and Hannes Meyer stood in. Meyer only lasted 2 years before being deposed and replaced by Ludwig Meis van der Rohe in 1930. In 1932 the school was moved to Berlin and due to the political situation at the time, was dissolved in 1933.

              After the break down of the school, the students emigrated across the world, and along with them, the Bauhaus concepts that we know today. As designers and artists today, the Bauhaus has inspired and influenced everything we do, we have taken their understanding of materials and the limitations placed upon them, in order to utilise their abilities.

              Wassily Kandinsky
            </h3>
            <p>
              Wassily Kandinsky was born in 1866 in Russia. He was a painter, widely known for his role in pioneering abstract art. In 1896, Kandinsky studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Kandinsky was largely influenced by the French impressionist style, and in particular the works of Claude Monet. He became fascinated by the work of Monet and his interpretation of colour. In 1910, Kandinsky produced his first abstract watercolour painting where he presented his bold lines and strong areas of colour. After a break from Germany at the beginning of the First World War, Kandinsky was invited back by Walter Gropius to teach at the Bauhaus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Kandinsky was part of a group named 'Der Blaue Reiter', formed in 1909 due to the negative response surrounding his previous painting; 'Last Judgement'. The group was made up of artists such as Franz Marc, Lyonel Feininger and Paul Klee. The group shared the same aims, which was to express spiritual truths through their work.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Kandinsky worked at the Bauhaus between 1922 and 1933. It was there where he taught classes in design basics, advanced theory and workshops on colour theory and composition. Kandinsky published his second book, 'Point and Line to Plane' in 1926 and continued to experiment with colour, line, composition and angle. His knowledge of colour and shape inspired and influenced the Bauhaus greatly. You can see a clear link between the 'Bauhaus style' and Kandinsky's own work. In 1928, Kandinsky became a German citizen and a year later held his first one man show in Paris. After the Bauhaus closed in 1933, Kandinsky moved to Berlin, then again to Paris, where he became a French citizen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Wassily Kandinsky died in December 1944, Neuilly-sur-Seine, in France. But is greatly admired to this day for his abstract paintings and powerful understanding of colour.
