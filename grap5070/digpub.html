              For this project we were asked to create a proposal for a digital version of our stories on the theme of migration for a web-based version of our magazine. This linked in well to our previous project on magazine design. By working digitally, we can add more content and create an interactive experience for the user.

              At the beginning I was not sure whether I wanted to go down the digital magazine or the micro site route. I looked online for examples of each so I could understand the similarities and differences between the two. After comparing both with the content of my magazine spread I thought the micro site format would allow a better over all user experience. Below are some examples of both digital magazines and micro sites that I found.

              Out of the three micro sites above, the one I was most drawn to was Roger Vivier's 'Hotel Vivier Cinematheque'. I was already aware of this site as I have been following the designer and subjet for a long time. The site was created in response to Covid 19 and is an advertisement for Roger Vivier's new collection. They have managed to create an interactive film to promote the brands latest collection. The audience is guided through the film by subject and actress Isabelle Huppert. Her characters allow the audience to chose the narrative of the film by giving them several options along the way. I think this has been a clever and creative way to tackle the restrictions Covid 19 has brought. It is a simple concept that has been executed well.

              The digital magazine that stands out for me is 'NYC', a travel magazine focused on art and design. I think one of the most captivating features of this magazine is the fact that it is almost all in black and white. This bold imagery has an emotional impact on the viewer and helps create an identity for the magazine. It looks clean and well made and seems easy for the audience to navigate. This is extremely important in any sort of design as it gives continuity and helps create a reputation for the brand.
