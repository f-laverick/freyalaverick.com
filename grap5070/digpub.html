              For this project we were asked to create a proposal for a digital version of our stories on the theme of migration for a web-based version of our magazine. This linked in well to our previous project on magazine design. By working digitally, we can add more content and create an interactive experience for the user.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              At the beginning I was not sure whether I wanted to go down the digital magazine or the microsite route. I looked online for examples of each so I could understand the similarities and differences between the two. After comparing both with the content of my magazine spread I thought the micro site format would allow a better over all user experience. Below are some examples of both digital magazines and micro sites that I found.

              Out of the three microsites above, the one I was most drawn to was Roger Vivier's 'Hotel Vivier Cinematheque'. I was already aware of this site as I have been following the designer and subjet for a long time. The site was created in response to Covid 19 and is an advertisement for Roger Vivier's new collection. They have managed to create an interactive film to promote the brands latest collection. The audience is guided through the film by subject and actress Isabelle Huppert. Her characters allow the audience to chose the narrative of the film by giving them several options along the way. I think this has been a clever and creative way to tackle the restrictions Covid 19 has brought. It is a simple concept that has been executed well.

              <br>
              The digital magazine that stands out for me is 'NYC', a travel magazine focused on art and design. I think one of the most captivating features of this magazine is the fact that it is almost all in black and white. This bold imagery has an emotional impact on the viewer and helps create an identity for the magazine. It looks clean and well made and seems easy for the audience to navigate. This is extremely important in any sort of design as it gives continuity and helps create a reputation for the brand.

              Extra Content
            </h3>
            <p>
              When I had finished looking into microsites and digital magazines I began gathering extra content to use. This included text, images and videos I would later edit. Once I had collected some of this content, the project itself started becoming clearer. Below is some of the extra content I found.

              User Flows
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had a vague idea of the content of the site, I went on to drawing out the user flow. This helped me understand and visualise how the pages of the site would link together and gave me an overall image of the site. User flows are helpful at ironing out problems when it comes to the user experience. I gave my initial sketches to a second person to look over to make sure it made sense. Below are images of my user flows.

              Initial Indesign MockUp
            </h3>
            <p>
              After I had created the user flows and had some idea of how I wanted the site to look, I then moved onto InDesign. I had no previous experience with the interactive elements on InDesign but wanted to give it a go.
              <br>
              <br>
              I had to do a lot of research and reading around before I started to get my head around it. Eventually I realised that InDesign didnâ€™t have the features I wanted for my website so I created a simpler version using InDesign only. I wanted to show I had still learned that skill.
              <br>
              <br>
              After the next crit session I asked whether it would be possible to build the website myself from scratch. Once I had the all clear I immediately felt more comfortable. I have built websites before but nothing as complicated as this.

              Final Design
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I knew I could build the website myself I started to look into the different languages I would need to build it. I had previous knowledge of HTML and CSS and a little on JavaScript, but as this was an interactive site, I had to do a lot of reading about JavaScript.
              <br>
              <br>
              One main feature that I could not get to work in InDesign was the timeline page. Building it myself allowed me to use a technique called parallax. This is where the background remains still but the content on top moves over it. This took a lot of work to put into place but I am more than happy with the outcome.
              <br>
              <br>
              With this project I really wanted to push myself and test what I thought was possible.
