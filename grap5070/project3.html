            <p>
              For this project we were asked to design a splash and turn page on both a six and eleven column grid. We had to center our designs around the theme of migration. I had a couple of ideas for this project and wanted to try both of them if time would allow. I began with the one I felt more comfortable with, which was exploring how the tide changes the position of the shoreline and surrounding area. I was exploring this theme for the font design project so thought it would be a good idea to carry it on for this one. I already had several images I could use in the design, so thought this would be a good starting point.

              I began by looking into examples of editorial design, looking specifically at the layout and use of grids.

              Next I began researching my theme to try and find possible content for the article. I looked online at a few websites and gathered relevant information. After that I started brainstorming some ideas for the headline, sub-heading, stand-first and pull quote.

              Once I had an overall idea of the content of the design I went on to drawing out some thumbnails. I kept them really simple and tried to get as many ideas down as possible. I did layouts for the six column and eleven column grid.

            <p>
              The next thing I did once I was happy with the thumbnail sketches was try to bring them to life. I did this by printing out the different elements and putting them together like a collage. This allowed me to actually see what the designs looked like life size with the images and copy on. This helped me work out which parts of the thumbnails worked well and which didn't, without wasting any time.

              Readly Go - Magazine Layouts
            </h3>
            <p>
              As I was moving over to InDesign, I found a website called Readly Go. It has access to hundreds of magazines that you can look at online. I found it helpful to see the double page spreads set out in front of me. The wide variety gave me much inspiration when designing my own magazine spreads. Below are some screen grabs of this website.

              InDesign Mock-Ups (Theme 1)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had a clear vision, I went over to InDesign and tried to get these ideas onto the screen. I began with the images and then added the copy. At this stage I have only used 'Lorem Ipsum' as filler copy as I am still in the planning stage. I have tried various headings and themes. At this stage I am exploring the possibilities surrounding the layout. Below are screen grabs of my first theme - the tides affect on the shoreline and surrounding environment. I Explored the limitations of both a 6 and 11 column grid.

              To explore the world of layout and magazine design, I decided to try andother theme. This time rather than the subject being landscapes I looked at a person. As both subjects are completely different it would mean two very different designs. Below are screen grabs of my second theme - the diverse career of an actress (Isabelle Huppert).
