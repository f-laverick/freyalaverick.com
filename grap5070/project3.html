            <p>
              For this project we were asked to design a splash and turn page on both a six and eleven column grid. We had to center our designs around the theme of migration. I had a couple of ideas for this project and wanted to try both of them if time would allow. I began with the one I felt more comfortable with, which was exploring how the tide changes the position of the shoreline and surrounding area. I was exploring this theme for the font design project so thought it would be a good idea to carry it on for this one. I already had several images I could use in the design, so thought this would be a good starting point.

            <p>
              I began by looking into examples of editorial design, looking specifically at the layout and use of grids.

              I spent a few days down on the west coast collecting potential images to use in the spreads. I tried to collect a range of images so I could give myself more options.

              Content Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              Next I began researching my theme to try and find possible content for the article. I looked online at a few websites and gathered relevant information. After that I started brainstorming some ideas for the headline, sub-heading, stand-first and pull quote.

              Thumbnails
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had an overall idea of the content of the design I went on to drawing out some thumbnails. I kept them really simple and tried to get as many ideas down as possible. I did layouts for the six column and eleven column grid.

              Collage Layouts
            </h3>
            <p>
              The next thing I did once I was happy with the thumbnail sketches was try to bring them to life. I did this by printing out the different elements and putting them together like a collage. This allowed me to actually see what the designs looked like life size with the images and copy on. This helped me work out which parts of the thumbnails worked well and which didn't, without wasting any time.
