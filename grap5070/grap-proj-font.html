              This project invoved creating our own typefaces from scratch. We were given the theme of migration as a starting point and asked to document our journey in a type journal. We had to design a typeface with the characters from A to Z in either upper or lowercase plus a set of numerals. As an extension to this project we then had to create a poster to show off our typefaces.

              Initial Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              In the brief, we were given the theme of migration as a starting point. The first thing I did in this project was brainstorm the different meanings of migration. I knew I didn't want to follow the most obvious route so being able to get all my ideas on paper first was very beneficial. <br><br>Once I had these ideas on paper, I was able to decide which route I wanted to follow. This ended up being the environmental route. I wanted to explore more specifically how the tide changes the shoreline and surrounding environment. I spent some time at Allonby and Maryport studying this in more detail. Below are images of my journey so far.

              Typography Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I had decided which direction I was taking this project, the next thing to do was look at typography that some way incorporated my idea of movement and change. I looked in books and on the internet at different typefaces that conveyed this sense of migration.
