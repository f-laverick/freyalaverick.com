          Session 11: The New York Design Influence
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              As previously discussed, much of the illustration and design of the late sixties and early seventies is associated with the west coast; San Francisco in particular. We often overlook the influence these psychedelic designs had on the rest of the world. These designs influenced New York especially, however in a much more controlled and modern way. The work produced in New York tended to be a reflection of the standard model of design and illustration and soon became known as the center of the advertising industry. Some of the big designers working in New York at this time included Saul Bass, Robert Brown John, Alvin Lustig, Otto Storch and Gene Frederico, among many more. Gene Frederico was of of the few designers to have popularised the idea that type could be part of an image. Another artist who played with this idea and helped pave the way for many designers today was Milton Glaser. Possibly most famous for his 'I love NY' logo, Glaser has shown to be a versatile illustrator and designer who helped the tourism industry boom. Glaser was one of a small group of designers that formed the Push Pin Studios in New York. The other designers and illustrators included Seymour Chwast, Reynold Ruffins and Edward Sorel.

             Herb Lubalin was another key figure during this time. He, like Frederico, also had the ability to popularise type as image. Lubalin became well known for designing fonts, the most popular being American Typewriter and Avant Garde. Below are examples of Lubalin's most famous works.
