                Over the years the duo created many memorable songs, but the one they are most well known for is Stay which was released in 1992.

                Stay was at the top of the UK Charts for eight weeks, which is the longest running song to stay at the top by any female duo to date.

                The song was part of a concept album which was based around a 50s B-movie called 'Cat-Women of the Moon'. The video was inspired by this film and shows one character falling in love with an earthling and him telling her that he had to leave and go back to earth.

                This song perfectly encapsulates the duo's relationship and dichotomy between themselves, as well as the contrast in tone; with Marcella singing in whistle register, giving the song an ethereal feel, and Siobhan giving a rough edged and dark performance. It is a perfect combintion of the two musical backgrounds.
