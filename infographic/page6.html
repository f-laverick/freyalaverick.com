                After 26 years of not speaking, the pair decided that it was time to try and repair their relationship.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the duo split under such harsh circumstances, this initial meet up was a very difficult time. Both Fahey and Detroit finally worked up the courage to have that converstaion.

                <br>
                Once they met up in 2018, things became clearer and they were able to forgive ad understand each other. They realised how similar they each were and found a new respect and appreciation for one another.
                <br>
                <br>
                After airing their differences, the pair decided to try and write new music. They both knew they always had a great creative partnership, so wanted to explore this further.
                <br>
                <br>
                They went out to Joshua Tree and wrote new material, some of which made light of their chequered past. The music video for one of their latest singles 'All the Queen's Horses', kept the iconic aesthetic of Shakespears Sister whilst also mocking their struggled relationship. The video shows a sense of healing whilst conveying the drama that occured between the pair.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2019, the duo announced that they would retunite on stage in a UK tour titled 'Ride Again'.
