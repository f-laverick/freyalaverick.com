              Shakespears Sister are an alternative rock and pop musical duo.
              <br>
              <br>
              The band was formed by Siobhan Fahey in 1988, after her departure from Bananarama and was meant as a solo act. The act became a duo in 1989 when Marcella Detroit joined.

              The duo brought something new to the music scene; they used their music as a vehicle to cultivate their own differences, and were never shown as products of the time - they seemed to stand slightly outside what was going on.

              The pair may seem like an unlikely match, both coming from very different musical and cultural backgrounds but their contrasting vocals became a defining part of the sound, with Fahey's deep tones complimenting Detroit's soprano voice. This meeting of light and shade was very new of its time and still feels fresh today.
