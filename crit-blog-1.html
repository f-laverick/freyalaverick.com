          Session 1: Semiotics

          What is Semiotics?
        </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Semiotics is a concept that has baffled many people. In short, it is a study of how signs and symbols create meaning. The ideas regarding semiotics have roots in the concepts of structuralism and essentialism. Structuralism is the idea that culture and society shape who we really are, in other words, our version of reality is established by words and other signs around us. Essentialism is the theory that everything has a set of attributes that are needed to identify its purpose.

              Semitoics explores how signs communicate cultural meanings within society. Signs in this context can be many things, some of which include words, images, physical actions, nature, clothes etc. All of which comminicate a meaning that is not the physical sign. An everyday example of semiotics in action is a stop sign. In this instance the sign is physical. We know by looking that the sign means to stop. This is something we have not been told, but as a society have learned. We are reacting to the metaphorical signs in front of us.

              Saussure
            </h3>
            <p>
              Ferdinand de Saussure was a Swiss linguist, philosopher and semiotician. He is considered one of the founders of modern day semiotics and in 1916 had a volume of work published. This was called the 'Course in General Linguistics'. In this, Saussure introduces the idea of the sign and suggests that it has two elements to it; the 'signifier' and the 'signified'. The signifier is the initial stimulus, while the signified is the reaction to the stimulus. Saussure explains that there is not usually an inherent link between the signifier and the signified. As a linguist, Saussure was interested in the idea that for instance the letters 'D-O-G' to mean dog, don't really have any natural link to the animal. We as a society have decided that the letters 'D-O-G' together mean a four legged animal.

              Peirce
            </h3>
            <p>
              Charles Sanders Peirce was an American logician and philosopher. Like Saussure, Peirce made major contributions to the world of semiotics. One of Peirce's main goals was to look at how we can use these earlier concepts outside of the written and spoken language. Rather than suggesting that the signifier never has a link to the signified, Peirce suggested that there may be many ways in which the two are connected. Peirce suggests that there are three main kinds if sign; an  icon, index and a symbol. An icon is something with a physical resemblance to the thing or idea it is trying to evoke. An index is a sign which has a link to the thing that is being evoked by direct relation. A symbol is something which has no relation between a signifier and the signified other than the fact that the society thinks the two should be linked, an example of this could be language.

              Roland Barthes - 'The World of Wrestling'
            </h3>
            <p>
              Roland Barthes was a French theorist, philosopher and semiotician. He is widely known as one of the driving forces in the field of semiotics through the analysis of many sign systems.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              During the 1950s, Barthes began to write a series of essays for a French magazine, 'Les Lettres Nouvelles'. In these essays he looked at and discussed the myths regarding popular culture. His collection 'Mythologies' was made up of 54 short essays looking at French pop culutre. I will be taking a closer look at one of these essays; 'The World of Wrestling'
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              'The World of Wrestling' explores Barthes' earlier thoery that anything can become a text if you choose to understand its signs and signifiers. Barthes is looking at how wrestling shows the transparency of actions and symbols. In the opening paragraph we are introduced to the idea that wrestling is a 'Spectacle of excess' therefore every gesture must be exaggerated like in 'Ancient theatre'. Both wrestling and Greek threatres show how 'A light without shadow generates an emotion without reserve'.

            <p>
              The video above shows a wrestling match. Here, Barthes' idea that wrestling is 'A spectacle of excess' is demonstrated. This idea can be shown from the roles of each wrestler down to the clothes they are wearing. It is important to understand that the names, actions and costumes of each wrestler are signs. They communicate certain things to the audience. Linking back to the idea of ancient theatres, this match shows an insight into an ancient artform that the Romans and Greeks would understand. In this case, the wrestler's are acting out society's basic concept of good and evil. The audience want a reason to back one of the fighters, this is part of what drives the match. Every action each wrestler makes is a symbol that links to the story being told and every action shown must be exaggerated in order to satisfy the audience's needs. By watching this match or any kind of artform, the spectator expects to see our shared belief systems solidified.

              Semiotics in Design
            </h3>
            <p>
              Semiotics is a very important part of design. It allows designers to understand the links between signs and the people who interpret them. It helps show us that our work has no meaning outside the set of factors that define it.    
            </p>
            <p>
              Physical road signs are a perfect example of this. They comminucate responsibilities and rules imposed for all road users. This helps create an unsaid guide for everyone. It is communicated through simple illustrations and few words.
