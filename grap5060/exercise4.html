          Exercise 4: Proximity & Repetition
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              This project was centered around the themes of proximity and repetition. We had to explore how we can visually link elements by through placament and how a running motif through a design can make it feel whole and connected, creating a sense of togetherness. For this project we were asked to create a visual identity for a furniture brand taking into account all principles we had previously covered.

              Research
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started by looking into existing brand identities and their respective stationery sets. This gave me a good idea of how these brands create a consistent design.

            <p>
              Many of the examples show good use of proximity and repetition. Proximity is important as it helps convey the message of the brand; related items tend to be grouped together, this contributes to the readability of the design and helps create visual balance. Repetition is important as it helps create visual interest while in many instances, ties the whole brand together. This can be done through the choice of typeface or a consistent colour scheme.

              The next thing I did was sketch out a few layouts for each dimension. This gave me the flexibility to choose between my designs and room to adapt them if needed.

              Next I began playing around in Illustrator, trying to become more familiar with the program. I was much more comfortable with InDesign and Photoshop, so I took some time to experiment with Illustrator. I found it difficult to make that initial shift, but it is beginning to feel more natural to me.

              Designs
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I was reasonably comfortable with Illustrator, I began putting my designs together. I started with the business cards thinking they would be less intimidating but I found them quite difficult due to my lack of experience, however once I had established a theme, the letterhead and compliment slip were much easier to complete. <br><br>I kept my designs very simple so I could focus on trying to make them look like a set that worked together.

            </h3>
            <p>
              When I was happy with the way the designs looked in Illustrator, I moved over to Graphic Burger to mock them up. This helped give me an even better idea of how the final designs looked.
