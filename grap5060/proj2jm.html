              This project was focussing on book covers. We were asked to find examples of book covers that fit into the categories of 'typographic', 'photographic' and 'illustrative'. We had to find covers that were eye catching and appropriate for their intended audiences. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Below are examples of covers I either found or had at hand.

          Target Audience
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              In any project, target audiences are very important. It is key to think about who your design is aimed at. Every demographic should be targeted in a different way. For instance a magazine about women's health is going to look and feel very different compared to a magazine about cycling. This is because each magazine is targeting a specific audience. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When doing any piece of design, the first thing to ask yourself is who is this aimed at? Understanding the audience is important when you begin to choose colours, typefaces and layouts for your design.

          Moodboards 
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              As this project is all about communicating with the audience I began by making some moodboards which explored the audiences we would be targeting. I looked at examples of design that matched these demographics appropriately. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We had to create book covers for a children's book, an adult non-fiction book and an adult fiction book. Below are examples of design that I think are a close match to these audiences. 
            </p>
            <br>
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood1.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood1small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood2.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood2small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood3.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood3small.jpg"></a>
              </div>
            <p>
              The covers for each target audience have been designed and look very different. The covers for the children's books quickly grab rhe reader's attention with the use of bright colour and fantasy like imagery. They clearly relate to the given demographic. One that stands out to me is 'Alice's Wonderland Tea Party'. I like the way the image of the tree spans the front and back cover as well as the spine. This creates a sense of togetherness and continuity. The images are clean and simple with some playfulness to them. Overall I think this is a strong design.
              <br>
              <br>
              The adult non-fiction covers are largely image based, this helps create a sense of realness to them. If there are any colours used they are even consistently muted or have a small pop of colour. This ties in to the serious tone of the book itself. One of the covers I am most drawn to is the one about Red Cloud. The powerful black and white image on the front cover immediately grabs the reader's attention. Having a person on the cover is a psychological technique used to capture and hold the viewer's gaze. Colour has been used well in this cover, the deep red ties the front and back covers together with the spine.
              <br>
              <br>
              The adult fiction covers convey an almost dreamlike state, this plays with the audience's imagination, making them wonder what comes next. These covers are more image/illustration based with small pops of colour to grab the viewer's attention. 'The Tao of Pooh' cover grabs my attention straight away, not because it is bold and bright, but because it is the opposite. The use of delicate illustrations helps convey this fantasy theme. I particularly like how the small birds connect both the front and back covers, this motif is small and could almost be missed, but is a nice addition to the design.

          Audience Personas
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Creating audience personas are a useful way to imagine what your audience wants. They are a fictional person that embodies the characteristics of the potential customers. It means that the end design should target the intended audience.
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are plans/ideas for audience personas for each of our target audiences.

          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Next I began brainstorming some visual ideas for each cover. I wanted to gather my ideas together before I started on the thumbnails. Below is the first stage of this journey.

          Talking Turkeys - Benjamin Zephaniah
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              For this cover, I wanted to stay away from imagery surrounding turkeys and look a bit further. I found it interesting that Zephaniah is mainly known for street poetry. As this book is aimed at getting children involved in poetry I thought that I could exploit this angle and focus on the street side. My initial thought was to look at graffiti. Graffiti is bright and colourful and will easily grab the viewer's attention. At this stage I began looking at related imagery and possible photos to use.

          Development of Ideas
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Once I had a few ideas on paper, I began narrowing them down until I was happy that I had a single idea I could explore further. For Talking Turkeys, I decided I wanted to look more at the idea of graffiti. This is something that will catch a child's attention and really speak to that audience. I like the idea of having the main image in black and white and having the title of the book in a bright graffiti style typeface.

          The Uninhabitable Earth - David Wallace-Wells
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              My initial idea for this cover was to focus less on the image of earth and more on the effects global warming. After looking into global warming more I began settling on the idea of rising sea levels. I was thinking about how this could convey the seriousness of the situation and how I could show this. I looked at underwater scenes, possibly refecting the idea of drowning. Below are some of my visual ideas so far.

            <p>
              When I had generated a few ideas for this book I went on to exploring one in more detail. This cover is the one that initially spoke to me - I wanted to really push the boundaries with this one and have fun. My main idea for this was to use the idea of the rising sea levels and play with the scale on the side. I thought about adding a more tactile quality to the outcome by having a tracing paper/see through sleeve with a marker on which would indicate the water level. This would add a kinesthetic element to the design and capture the audience's attention.

          Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee - Meera Syal

          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Out of the three books, this is the one I found the most difficult to come up with ideas for. This may be becuase the plot of this book was harder to condense than the other two. After looking further into the book, I had a bit of a breakthrough and managed to think of a few ways to convey the meaning. One idea was to focus more on the cultures. When I read the synopsis for the book it immediately reminded me of A Thousand Splendid Suns. In this, the burka symbolised an invisibility and almost freedom. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to go down such a specific route, but the idea of linking the cultures interested me. I also liked the idea of revealing this hidden culture within London. I looked at the London skyline and began thinking about adding decorative Indian illustrations.

              With this cover I found it quite difficult to land on an idea. After a long time doing research and thinking about the book I found a concept I was happy with. It was focusing on an earlier idea about the merge of the two cultures. I wanted to show the cultures but from a distance; in a more abstract, less obvious way. I remembered watching a company's advert which was made in response to Covid 19. It was an advert for a luxury shoe brand, but made into an interactive game/film in which the audience could participate. There was one part of the game that really caught me - it was a take on an animation that showed a castle being revealed behind shrubs and bushes. I thought this could be explored further on the book cover - exposing this almost hidden Indian culture in London.
