              This project was focussing on book covers. We were asked to find examples of book covers that fit into the categories of 'typographic', 'photographic' and 'illustrative'. We had to find covers that were eye catching and appropriate for their intended audiences. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Below are examples of covers I either found or had at hand.

          Target Audience
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              In any project, target audiences are very important. It is key to think about who your design is aimed at. Every demographic should be targeted in a different way. For instance a magazine about women's health is going to look and feel very different compared to a magazine about cycling. This is because each magazine is targeting a specific audience. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When doing any piece of design, the first thing to ask yourself is who is this aimed at? Understanding the audience is important when you begin to choose colours, typefaces and layouts for your design.

          Moodboards 
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              As this project is all about communicating with the audience I began by making some moodboards which explored the audiences we would be targeting. I looked at examples of design that matched these demographics appropriately. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We had to create book covers for a children's book, an adult non-fiction book and an adult fiction book. Below are examples of design that I think are a close match to these audiences. 
            </p>
            <br>
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood1.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood1small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood2.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood2small.jpg"></a>
                <a href="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood3.jpg"> <img src="../images/graphy2/proj2/mood3small.jpg"></a>
              </div>
            <p>
              The covers for each target audience have been designed and look very different. The covers for the children's books quickly grab rhe reader's attention with the use of bright colour and fantasy like imagery. They clearly relate to the given demographic. One that stands out to me is 'Alice's Wonderland Tea Party'. I like the way the image of the tree spans the front and back cover as well as the spine. This creates a sense of togetherness and continuity. The images are clean and simple with some playfulness to them. Overall I think this is a strong design.
              <br>
              <br>
              The adult non-fiction covers are largely image based, this helps create a sense of realness to them. If there are any colours used they are even consistently muted or have a small pop of colour. This ties in to the serious tone of the book itself. One of the covers I am most drawn to is the one about Red Cloud. The powerful black and white image on the front cover immediately grabs the reader's attention. Having a person on the cover is a psychological technique used to capture and hold the viewer's gaze. Colour has been used well in this cover, the deep red ties the front and back covers together with the spine.
              <br>
              <br>
              The adult fiction covers convey an almost dreamlike state, this plays with the audience's imagination, making them wonder what comes next. These covers are more image/illustration based with small pops of colour to grab the viewer's attention. 'The Tao of Pooh' cover grabs my attention straight away, not because it is bold and bright, but because it is the opposite. The use of delicate illustrations helps convey this fantasy theme. I particularly like how the small birds connect both the front and back covers, this motif is small and could almost be missed, but is a nice addition to the design.

          Audience Personas
          </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Creating audience personas are a useful way to imagine what your audience wants. They are a fictional person that embodies the characteristics of the potential customers. It means that the end design should target the intended audience.
              <br>
              <br>
              Below are plans/ideas for audience personas for each of our target audiences.

              Next I began brainstorming some visual ideas for each cover. I wanted to gather my ideas together before I started on the thumbnails. Below is the first stage of this journey.
