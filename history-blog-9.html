              After the Second World War, Britain had to borrow a significant amount of money from the US in order to get back on its feet again. It took Britain about 50 years to repay this loan. Times were difficult for Britain after the war with the rationing and lack of money, tensions were high and moral was low.

              During this period, life was beginning to be reflected through illustration. Some of the main illustrators of the time included Norman Rockwell, Bob Peak, Bernie Fuchs, Robert Weaver and Barbara Bradley, among many more.

              Norman Rockwell was an American illustrator and painter. He is possibly most well known for the covers of The Saturday Evening Post as well as his idealistic portrayal of American life.
