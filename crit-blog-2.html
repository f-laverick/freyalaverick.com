          Planes of Expression and Abstraction
        </h3>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              Words are arbitary signifiers that do not resemble what they describe, they require an understanding and knowledge of language. The plane of expression describes how something is said and how that can affect the reading of meaning.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Images are iconic signifiers that resemble exactly what they describe. They are usually experienced before words and can be in the form of memories. The plane of abstraction can describe how an image is captured and rendered visually. This affects the reading of meaning.

              Anchorage
            </h3>
            <p>
              Anchorage is a term used by Barthes to describe the dinamic between words and visuals. In our visual culture it is rare that words and images are not placed together; we see it a lot in signs and packaging. McCloud stated that there are many different types of anchorage.

              Word Specific - Words (text or visual) which provide all or some of the information needed to decode a message. (Star Wars crawl text)
              <br>
              Image Specific - Images that provide all or most of the information needed to decode the message. (The Longest Day of the Future - Lucas Varela) 
              <br>
              Dual Message - Words and images that communicate the same message either in tone or content. (Scott McCloud - Making Comics)
              <br>
              Interdependent or Convergent - Words and images that work together whilst contributing information independently, to convey an idea which neither could do alone. (Childrens Storybooks)
              <br>
              Parallel or Divergent - Words and images that appear to follow different paths, and/or communicate ideas that do not seem to intersect. (Comic Books)

              Denotation and Connotation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Denotation is the most immediate reading of a sign while connotation is the secondary reading of a sign. For instance, the reader may pick up on the link between one text and another (intertextuality). Roland Barthes believed that a coded interpretation (a myth) is relayed at the level of connotation.

              The Treachery of Images
            </h3>
              <div class="main">
                <img src="../images/graphy2/crit/words/pipe.jpg">
              </div>
              <br>
            <p>
              Ren√© Magritte was a surrealist painter. The Treachery of Images was painted in 1929 and shows a romantic depiction of a pipe.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The french text translates to 'this is not a pipe'. This could be seen as a contradiction because the image clearly shows a pipe, however Magritte is trying to show us that what we see is different to the object it actually is. He once said that his painting could not be a real pipe because you cannot physically put tabacco in it. This image is an iconic signifier as it resembles the thing it is describing. In this case the plane of abstraction is the beautiffuly painted pipe. It is painted so well that it resembles a realistic pipe. Pipes give connotations to being old-fashioned, bad for your health and a status symbol.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In the case of this painting, you could say that the anchorage being used is interdependent/congergent. This is because the text and image work together in conveying the meaning and message, whilst also working separately.
