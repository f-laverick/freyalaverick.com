<h3>And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</h3>
<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. You are the last hope of the universe.</p>

<p>I'll get my kit! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. And I'm his friend Jesus. Take me to your leader! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
<p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p>
<p>And then the battle's not so bad? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! But existing is basically all I do! Shut up and get to the point!</p>
<p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Leela's gonna kill me. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
<p>What are their names? Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
<p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
