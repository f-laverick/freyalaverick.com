              This project consisted of working with a 'live' client on a brief. We were given the briefing by the client then had to create our own version of it.

              My group were paired with the 'Daydream Theatre' company. The aims of this group were to make fairytale stories more exciting and accessible for children again. They would take their productions to primary schools, targeting Key Stage 2 children in particular.

              The first thing I needed to do was to work out who the target audience was. The productions were going to be aimed at children in schools but the initial contact would go to the teachers. In reality, the children would not have a say in whether they attend or not, the decision would have been made for them. This makes the target audience quite tricky. I aimed the identity at slightly more mature children, whilst still keeping it 'dream like'.
