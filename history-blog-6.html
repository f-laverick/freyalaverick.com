          Session 6: The Ulm School of Design
        </h1>
          <section class="para1">
            <p>
              The Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Ulm; otherwise known as the Ulm School of Design was a design college in Germany that attempted to revive the Bauhaus ideas and beliefs. The school was founded in 1953 in memory of Hans and Sophie Scholl, members of the 'White Rose'. The brother and sister were arrested by the Gestapo for handing out anti fascist leaflets and then later executed by the Nazis. In 1946, Inge Scholl and Otl Aicher attempted to revive the Bauhaus ideals.

              The school began in 1953 as a continuation of the Bauhaus experiment. Max Bill, an ex student of the Bauhaus helped make this a reality. Like the Bauhaus, the Ulm School of Design had similar beliefs. Both schools offered a basic design course, teaching colour theory, composition, perspective, as well as complementing the curriculum with non art based subjects. Instead of having more specialised subject areas, the Ulm School grouped the topics under more general headings. This allowed them to have access to a wider range of specialists, and ultimately making the school the center of cutting edge research and design. They believed that the link with industrialisation was the key into the rebuilding of the society after the war.

              Tomas Maldonado was an Argentine painter and designer, possibly most well known for the design theory of the Ulm Model. Maldonado viewed design as involving the whole society, not just an independent activity. He helped the school focus less about art and more about objective design. He saw the designer as having an equal role in the design and manufacturing process.

              By this stage, the school was very much about the industrial process and new technological advancements. After the was technology as a whole was feared; it was seen to have no limits. This meant that new technology that the school designed, like radios, had to be almost disguised as to look less threatening. The school collaborated with the industrial designer, Dieter Rams to create the new version of the Braun radio. This, to this day, is one of the biggest changes in product design. Rams helped the school understand that it is the design of the system rather than the object and that it is the younger generations that are more willing to embrace new technology.

              In all, the school aimed to show how design an art can be used as a force for social good. The brief flowering of the two schools have had such an astonishing effect on design in the 21st century.

              Otl Aicher
            </h3>
            <p>
              Otl Aicher was born in Germany in 1922 and was one of the most influential graphic designers of his time. He is probably most well known for his posters of the 1972 summer Olympics in Munich.

              Aicher was good friends with Hans and Sophie Scholl, both of whom were executed by the Nazis in 1943. Like the Scholl's, Aicher was strongly against the Nazis and as a result, was arrested in 1937 for refusing to join the Hitler Youth. As a result of this, Aicher was made to join the army and forced to fight in the Second World War. After many attempts to leave, Aicher deserted the army in 1945 and sought refuge with the Scholl's. During this period at the School's, Aicher fell in love with Inge Scholl and married her in 1952.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In 1953, Aicher and Scholl both founded the Ulm School of Design which ran until 1968 when it was closed due to financial and political situations.

            <br>
            <p>
              Just before the school had closed, Aicher was approached by the organisers of the Olympics and asked to be the lead designer for the 1972 games. Aicher produced a set of pictograms inspired by the 1964 games. Each pictogram was a clear representation of the given sport. These simple. clean designs can be seen to have inspired many artists today, as well as the Olympic games themselves.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In 1980, Aicher became associated with the German kitchen manufacturer Bulthaup. In 1988 he created his own font, Rotis font family and designed the logo for Munich airport, consisting of the letter M.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Aicher died in 1991 in Gunzburg after he was hit by a vehicle.
